<p>With the days that the poet has
termed the rarest, the longest, sunniest
days of the year, there had
come to Brighton at once sad and happy
days.</p>

<p>For it was that time in early June when to
those who have been faithful is given the
credit they so richly deserve for hard study
and achievement; the time also of parting
from loved classmates and companions in
glory on the field of sport, of leaving behind
for a time, or perhaps forever, the dear old
school and the campus, the custodians of
so many delightful associations.</p>

<p>Golden moments are those, indeed, even
though shadows mar the perfect glow of youth
and hope and aspirations. But shadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
there must be, for school is but a part of life's
too brief journey taken through many
unlighted places, as well as in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Herbert Whitcomb, over-tall and manly-looking
for his seventeen years, strolled alone
down the broad boardwalk that led from
class-rooms to dormitories, his hands in his
pockets, his head bowed in earnest thought.
He turned off suddenly into one of the clusters
of spruces that dotted the spacious grounds
and finding a bench sank down dejectedly,
his comely face, usually expressive of good
humor, now showing only sorrow.</p>

<p>It was just after final examinations, and
other students, singly, in pairs and in groups,
were among the trees enjoying the restfulness
of the out-of-doors. Two standing within a
few yards could be heard talking.</p>

<p>"They have joined, but I don't know what
regiment. Gosh! What a difference the war
is going to make right here in good old
Brighton Academy! There's Corwin and
Joe Little and 'Fatty' Benson in the American
flying squadron; and Jed Harris and a bunch
of the fellows are in the navy."</p>

<p>"Jack Hammond and Ted Wainwright&mdash;they
went underseas with the Yankee submarine
fleet, didn't they?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"You bet! There's dare-devil action for
you! Fighting the sea wolves in their own
element! Shouldn't wonder if those Brighton
submarine boys blow up the Kiel Canal before
they're through! Got brains, those fellows.
Well, things are moving. As sure as shooting,
we're going to make the world safe for democracy!
I guess I'll have to get into the game
myself. It isn't any fun sitting on the
bleachers. I'm goin' to enlist."</p>

<p>"Why not wait till you're of age and then
let 'em draft you?"</p>

<p>"Not for me, kid. I want to have my
choice of the branch of service I join."</p>

<p>"You've made up your mind, then?"</p>

<p>"Yep. Me for the Engineers' Corps.
Believe me, there's no more important branch
of the army&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young men had started off and now
their voices died away among the trees.
Whitcomb suddenly sat up very straight, his
hands on his knees, and gazed fixedly before
him, seeing nothing, but in his mind's eye
seeing much, for a thought, not altogether
new, had come to him and he was beginning
to bite down on it hard. The boy's clenched
hand went up into the air and then smote
the bench seat quite forcibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Must've smashed that fly, or was it a
knotty problem?" said a jovial voice, the
branches of the spruces parting to let the
speaker through; a red-headed, freckled,
squint-eyed lad who was quite as homely
as the one whom he addressed was good
looking.</p>

<p>Whitcomb greeted the newcomer sadly.
"Well, old man, this is my last day on earth.
It was my hopes I was smashing."</p>

<p>Roy Flynn, classmate, loyal friend, all-round
good fellow, with laughing Irish eyes,
threw back his head, opened a mouth that
might almost have made a barn door jealous
and very unmistakably chuckled.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' t' die with ye, then! What's
the crime for which we're bein' executed?"</p>

<p>"Listen! Got a letter from the legal
luminary this morning," began Whitcomb.
"Contents nothing but words and to the
effect that the cash is gone. It's now up to
me right away to hustle round and get myself
some more, somehow. That's not so bad,
but it means no more school, or of Brighton,
anyway. It means this, too: that I, Herb
Whitcomb, have got to get back there among
the more lowly where I belong and travel
the back alleys awhile&mdash;it's only the lucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
that can hit the highways. Much pleasure
in the thought that some of my old friends
are saying: 'Huh! Took a tumble, didn't
he? Money ran out. Tried to fly too high
in the first place, I guess,' and all that sort of
thing. But least pleasant will be that you
and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roy interrupted with a sudden roar.</p>

<p>"'Whurrah! Whurrah!' as me old granddad
used to say. Tin-can the blue stuff and the
pessimistic rot! There's going to be nothing
unpleasant concerning you and I&mdash;I mean
you and me. And why, me lad? Because
do I see meself letting the misfit circumstances
of this changeable world make a monkey of
me? Yes, I do not! Life is too brief, and
sorry the day when one bids good-by to
friends and fun; one's a fool who does and as
me old granddad in Ireland used to say:
'Bad cest to 'em!' Am I right?"</p>

<p>"No doubt, if I only knew what you were
talking about. I can't help being thick-headed."</p>

<p>"Listen, Herb. Ye won't go to work this
summer and ye won't quit school! I'm talkin'
to ye. Me old dad has enough for the both
of us and I'll lend ye enough for to see ye
through in grand shape, if ye will coach me
along to keep up with ye. Are ye on?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Roy, I couldn't do that. I couldn't,
really. You know a fellow has some pride,
and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, but tin-can it this once. Ye've
got no business to shove it at me and ye
know, me lad, I'm never goin' to say one
word about this to a single, solitary soul.
It's between us only."</p>

<p>"I know that, old man; I would be sure of
that, but even then I couldn't&mdash;I&mdash;you see,
I would know it myself, and I could never
be quite happy if I weren't paying my own
way."</p>

<p>"But ye'll be coachin' me and I'll be payin'
ye wages. Now, do ye mind that? Are ye
so blamed big-headed&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"'Fraid so. You see, I wouldn't be half
earning what I'd need. And as for the
summer&mdash;well, there's another hundred and
thirty dollars due and ready for me, my
guardian writes, so I might spend a week or so
with you in the mountains; then hunt a job.
Come on in town with me now, will you?
I want to mail this letter to the legal
luminary."</p>

<p>The two boys, arm in arm, made their way
across the juniper and spruce covered hillside,
then into the broad walk and through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
high stone gateway to the street. The post
office was half a mile away.</p>

<p>Stepping along briskly and discussing future
plans, they were almost past a little crowd,
mostly of students and small boys, collected
on the sidewalk when quick-witted Roy, not
at the moment speaking, caught a few words
that made him halt instantly and turn.
Herb gazed at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"&mdash;und vat I care for der law?" came a
guttural voice. "Der American beebles vas
fools to go to war mit Chermany, for vat can
dey do? Der Chermans is fighters und
drained up to der minute und you oxpect
dese American chumps vill haff any show mit
dem? Uh?"</p>

<p>In a moment Herbert and Roy had joined
the assemblage and had observed the speaker
to be a big, large-girthed German possessing
a very red nose, a glowering countenance and
a manner contemptuous and self-exalted.
One could read upon him, at a glance, that he
held the unalterable opinion that there was
no other country like Germany, no people
to compare with the Germans and for all the
rest of the world, no matter to what section
he might owe his present prosperity, he had
an altogether poor opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The audience seemed strangely silent before
the German's denunciations and Herb glanced
about him. Two seniors of Brighton were
there and two others of the sophomore class,
each one a youth of possibly doubtful courage,
more in love with the refinements of books
than with the danger of engaging in too
strenuous argument with a bearish, bully-ragging,
irresponsible foreigner. The rest of
the bunch were youngsters from the public
school.</p>

<p>One bright-faced, quick-witted boy among
the latter there was who alone evidently had
the courage of his convictions:</p>

<p>"Aw, gwan! What ye tryin' t' give us?
Our fellers'll make that big stiff Hindenburg
look like a chicken hit with a brick! Them
Dutchmen ain't sa much!"</p>

<p>"You vas only a leedle kid und you don'd
know noddings," spouted the German.
"Chermans ain'd Dutchmens; dey vas ten
times as goot. You fellers can fight, heh?
Vere do you keep dese fighters? I ain'd seen
noddings off dem; dey vas all crawled in a
hole. Und der soldiers off der Vaterlandt,
dey make 'em crawl in a hole chust like dat!"
and he snapped his pudgy fingers.</p>

<p>Roy looked at Herb, who was gazing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
big man through narrowed lids, his face
turning red. The lad of pure Celtic stock
felt his own blood boil and his ready tongue
found release.</p>

<p>"Now, ain't ye got the ignorant nerve to
stand right out here in America and talk
like a fat tomat? De ye know that might
not be quite safe everywhere?"</p>

<p>"Safe? Safe? Ach, I see noddings onsafe!
I don't see no metals on nobotty roundt here
vat iss going to make id onsafe for me. Und
vat I tinks I says, heh? Und nobotty can
stop me, needer!"</p>

<p>"Better not think too much, then, Dutchy,"
advised Roy.</p>

<p>"Say, young feller, you vas oldt enough to
know bedder den to call me Dutch. I vas Cherman.
Und chust you remember dot; see?"</p>

<p>"That's so, Germany. I guess it's an
insult to the honest Dutch to call you that.
By the way you fellows have been carrying
on over there in Belgium, burning, looting,
murdering women and children&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dot vas a lie! All a lie! Newspapers,
newspapers! Der American newspapers iss
chust like der beeble, all liars! Und you belief
'em, py gollies, effrybotties. Efen Vilson,
he ain'dt got no better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on, there! You're going much too
far! Speak with respect of the President of
the United States, or don't speak of him at
all!" This came, like a shot, from Herb,
and the boy's eyes flashed into the little pig's
peepers of the big foreigner. A cheer went
up from the crowd and Roy slapped his chum
on the back.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff! Give him some more
of that!"</p>

<p>The German took a few steps forward facing
Herb, the crowd giving way. The man's
arm was raised.</p>

<p>"Vat you got to say aboudt it, heh? I
say chust vat I bleese. Who vas you? Purdy
soon I ketch you py der neck und twist id
like a chicken gets der axe, heh?"</p>

<p>"You really couldn't mean to be so unkind,
could you? Now, honest." Herb was sarcastic.
"Now, I'll tell you what we'll do to
fix you. You come along down town and we'll
just turn you over to the cops. They'll
want to investigate you. How about it,
fellows? Hadn't we better take him right
now?"</p>

<p>One senior, scenting trouble, began to edge
away, but the others responded by general
acclamation. It might mean a serious scrimmage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
but they were ready for it; all that
had been needed to call them into action was
a leader.</p>

<p>But the big German proved to be the actual
aggressor. Permitting his anger to get the
better of his judgment and quicker on his
feet than his girth would indicate, he made a
rush straight at Herbert. No doubt he
meant to end matters by a sudden defeat of
the leader and thus intimidate the others.
But like many German plans this one did not
fully work out.</p>

<p>Herb merely side-stepped. As a most
promising pupil he had long received special
training in boxing from the capable athletic
instructor. He was instantly out of the
man's reach as the big arms and fat hands
reached to seize him; he was just a mite too
far away also when the ponderous fist, swung
round in the air, aimed at his head. But the
German was not out of Roy's reach.</p>

<p>The foreigner's artillery may have been
heavier, but that of the American youth was
handier and reached farther. The man's
blow, that surely would have done damage
had it landed, by its momentum had carried
him half off his feet when Herb just stepped
forward, shot out his arm and stepped back
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>The German got it precisely in the right
place on the jaw and he collapsed like a
clothes-horse with the props knocked from
under it.</p>

<p>It was a good deal like a fat pig doing the
wallow act, for the man did not remain long
quiescent. He rolled over to his hands and
knees, then got to his feet and letting out a
roar like a mad bull, commenced swinging his
arms windmill fashion. Then there was
another rush at Herb.</p>

<p>The incident was repeated, precisely and
accurately, except that the blow on the jaw
was this time harder and that the German lay
prone somewhat longer. He arose this time
to a sitting posture and through his little
eyes regarded Herb with something akin to
wonder. The boy, never hard-hearted, turned
away. But Roy stood before the undignified
foe.</p>

<p>"Now, you see, Dutchy, what is bound to
happen to you if you get gay. Pretty much
the same thing is going to happen to the
German Army before long. If you don't
stop shooting off your big mouth this'll happen
to you." And the lad drew his fingers around
his neck to indicate a strangling rope.</p>

<p>The growing crowd, many others having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
now joined it, set up a laugh and then a
decided cheer at this; the German blinked at
his opponents, felt his jaw, made a horrible
grimace and finally, getting to his feet, made
off slowly across the street. The crowd
jeered after him, then turned with appreciation
toward Herbert. But that worthy,
hating laudation, beckoned to Roy, and the
two walked quickly on their way.</p>

<p>"One battle won, b'gorry!" Roy could
not refrain from some comment. "Say,
Herb, they were sure nice ones that you
handed him and right where he needed them
most, too&mdash;in his talker. Reckon that was
about the first victory over the Germans,
but guess it won't be the last."</p>

<p>"I'm going to try to help that it isn't,
Roy."</p>

<p>"What you mean, lad?"</p>

<p>"That chump's words set me to thinking,"
Herb said. "It's up to just such as I am to
take a hand; a bigger hand. I'm going right
now to the recruiting office and enlist."</p>

<p>"You are? By cracky! Enlist, is it?
That's the stuff! Well, you know what I
told you about you and me. I'm going to
enlist, too, if you do! I'll have to write for
me old man's consent, of course, but he'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
give it. Come on! Let's go see what we
gotta do." And the youth raised his voice
in impromptu song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Boom a laddie! Boom a laddie!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let's go get a gun,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Joining Hands with Uncle Sam</span></p>


<p>Captain Pratt, recruiting officer,
glanced up to see two young fellows
approaching, evidently with some intention
of engaging his services. And for
the big and important cause he was appointed
to aid he was more than willing that his services
should be engaged, heavily engaged, at
any and all times.</p>

<p>The world was at war; his beloved country
was mixed up in this contest, hopefully for
the right and as humanely as it is possible to
be when fighting. It required soldiers to
fight and men and more men and still more
men out of which to make these soldiers which
were to win in a glorious cause for liberty and
honor.</p>

<p>And so, because of the position of his
office and the considerable number of students
coming to him there, he may have been a
little less careful about sticking to the precise
regulations concerning very young applicants.
The captain had a weakness for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
youngsters, being something of an overgrown
boy himself at times, and this may have had
much to do with his leniency.</p>

<p>The upshot of it was that, a little while
later, after some information had been
exchanged, questions had been asked mostly
on the part of the captain, and oaths had been
taken, the military gentleman dismissed the
two young fellows with this parting injunction:</p>

<p>"Now you understand. Both of you report
to the commanding officer at Camp Wheeler
as soon as you can arrange matters. Come
to me for cards to him. I need hear nothing
more from you, Whitcomb, as you say your
guardian will be willing and anxious for you
to enlist. I'll want a letter of consent from
your father, Flynn. Flynn? That might be
somewhat of a Celtic name, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yiss, sorr!" said Roy, standing very
straight and saluting in the most approved
manner, at which the captain laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Well, go your ways, lads, and report to
me as soon as you can get away from school
in the proper manner. I rather think that
Uncle Sam can make very promising soldiers
of you both, especially considering the shooting
practice you've had."</p>

<p>"Say, Herb," said Roy, as soon as the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
had got well away from the office, "that guy
thought I could shoot, too, but I didn't tell
him so. I only bragged you up."</p>

<p>"Too much; I don't like it, Roy. But
it's natural; you will blarney, you dear, old
chump. You made it so strong that I guess
he thought we're an entire regiment of experts.
Well, you can't help it now. The only thing
to do is for you to learn to shoot."</p>

<p>"But could I, Herb?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Glory be! Hearken, me lad! Come
along. I'm goin' to get me a rifle and ammunition
and you get your gun and we'll go out
and blow the face off of nature. I'll buy
your ammunition and you teach me; see?
Come on."</p>

<p>In vain Herbert protested that it was needless
to spend money for a gun; that Roy
could practise with Herb's own, a splendid
repeating weapon, of .30-caliber, won by the
boy at the individual shoot of the Interstate
Prep School Match a month before.</p>

<p>No; Roy must have his own gun.</p>

<p>From tiny boyhood, when a chummy
father had put into the youngster's hands
his first air-gun, Herbert had shown a marked
genius, if it may be so called, for aiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
straight and knowing just when to press a
trigger. Then, with his first cartridge gun,
a light target 22, which he had brought to
school and taken on many a hike into the
broad country, the boy had become, as Roy
put it, almost unreasonably expert, knocking
acorns and chestnut burs from high limbs,
cutting tall weeds and hanging vines in half
with the first shot, tossing a stone or a tin
can in air with one hand and nine times out
of ten plunking it fairly before it reached the
ground.</p>

<p>But with all this ability to put a bullet
just where he wanted it to go, the lad was
unwilling to use his skill in taking the life of
any creature. He would not kill even a hawk
or a crow, though sometimes sorely tempted
to try a shot at such birds on the wing. Once
he sat on a log, with rifle across his knees,
while a fox leaped on a fence not forty yards
away and stood balancing and curious for
half a minute.</p>

<p>"We've got no real right to kill these
things," he said to Roy, who was always
with him. "They've got as much right to
live as we have and they were here before we
were. A fellow might shoot something if he
were hungry, but not decently just for sport.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
These animals, birds and things, are getting
too scarce as it is."</p>

<p>The town supported a first-class hardware
store and its stock of guns was sufficient for
the most exacting selection to be made therefrom.
When the boys reached their room in
the dormitory an hour later and the new gun
was unpacked, Herb took it up and toyed
with it lovingly. It was one of the most
modern of sporting rifles, also shooting a
30-30-160 cartridge, the first figure referring
to the caliber, the second to the grains of
powder by weight and the third to grains of
lead. The workmanship, the finish, the
design were perfect.</p>

<p>Herb, perforce, must make potent remarks
concerning the weapon.</p>

<p>"Now you have something that you can
rely on whenever you look over the barrel
and press the trigger in the right way. It'll
do the trick and never fail you if you treat it
as it deserves; keep it clean. Remember to
do that. We'll take the stock off, unlimber
the breech, warm all the parts and run melted
vaseline all through it; then, when it gets
cold, that sticks in there as grease, which
beats any liquid oil all to pieces. In the
barrel only always use but a drop or two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
oil on your rag or brush and with that brass-jointed
cleaning rod you can clean from either
end. If you use an iron rod, clean only from
the breech end; I'll bet they'll tell us that in
the army.</p>

<p>"And, Roy, you've got to be careful how
you shoot, what you shoot at and what's
back of it around here. If it goes off accidentally
some old time, or there isn't anything
back of what you shoot at to stop the
bullet, why, the blamed thing is apt to go
on and kill a cow in the next county. These
steel-jacketed bullets will punch through six
inches of seasoned oak, twice as much pine,
and clean through an ordinary tree of green
wood. But say, Roy, you don't care how you
spend your money; a thousand cartridges!
I'll use about two hundred of them and I
want to pay you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You go plumb to smash; will you? Pay
nothin'! Ain't you goin' to teach me how to
hit a bumble-bee at half a mile? We'll start
to-morrow and work regular until Commencement."</p>

<p>It was even so, except the bumble-bee
stunt. Excellence generally follows determination
where all else is favorable, and Roy
possessed good eyes, steady nerves and faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in his own ability and that of his teacher.
The result was that before the cartridges
were half spent the one-time disinterested
greenhorn was that no longer; he could put
ten shots within a six-inch circle and do it
pretty quickly, too, and he had completely
fallen in love with what he called "the fun
and fine art of firearms; hooray!"</p>

<p>But however interested he became in his
own efforts, it was as nothing to his intense
delight over Herbert's wonderful skill. He
ran back and forth between target and gunner
like a playful dog chasing a thrown stick.</p>

<p>"Ye've got the center pushed into one big
hole now!" he would shout, "and ye've got
only one or mebbe two outside the center
and none near the ring! It's wonderful! I
might shoot lead enough into yon old quarry
bank to make a ten-million-dollar mine of it
and never be as certain of hittin' the center
as what you are each time you let her go.
Shooters, like poets, are sure born and not
made."</p>

<p>The departure from dear old Brighton, the
saying of farewells that might be final, the
leaving of scenes that would always be reminiscent
of happy days and worthy efforts
with benefits for life, came all too soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>With his one bag and gun case, his sole
possessions, Herbert Whitcomb stood on the
station platform waiting until Roy Flynn had
checked his numerous trunks and boxes. He
glanced again at the letter from Captain
Pratt, the recruiting officer, introducing both
boys to Brigadier-General Harding in command
at Camp Wheeler. The captain had
invited them to peruse it and emotional Roy
had been greatly tickled by the contents. It
read in part:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I write you about these boys because they are
younger than we have been accepting them, those
from the same school heretofore having been seniors.
But these are manly fellows, athletes in training,
spending much of their time out of doors on long
hikes and week-end camping trips and, most important
of all, they are both very excellent shots, Whitcomb
excelling almost anything that I have ever heard of,
as I have it from good authority. In view of the
Special Inquiry No. 10, June 1st, I believed this would
interest you."</p></blockquote>

<p>Special Inquiry, eh? The captain had not
explained that. It was probably a matter
for higher authorities to explain and no doubt
they would hear of it again. Surely it
related to shooting, and most certainly the
ability to handle a gun much better than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
average man must be an important thing in
relation to soldiering.</p>

<p>Roy returned just as the train pulled in
and the two went aboard. The boys were
now on their way for a few days' visit to the
elegant Flynn home and, from a previous
experience, Herb knew he would be made
most welcome.</p>

<p>After that came the journey and the introduction
to Camp Wheeler.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Getting into Harness</span></p>


<p>"Compn-eee, atten-tion!"</p>

<p>These were the first words of any
significance that greeted Herbert
Whitcomb and Roy Flynn when they alighted
from a long train and took their first and
interested view of an army encampment.</p>

<p>But all along&mdash;in fact, ever since they
entered the train in another state, at Roy's
home town of Listerville&mdash;the lads had witnessed
many and constant sights that
reminded them of the stern duty now before
them. They had taken the oath to serve
Uncle Sam from that very June day and they
had traveled with many others sworn to the
same earnest, fearless task.</p>

<p>With crude, small bundles in hand&mdash;for
thus they had come, knowing full well that
equipment for new duties would be given
them&mdash;the boys, amidst a crowd of eager
welcomers clad in khaki and many fellow
travelers in plain clothes, filed in a slow-moving
line across a tramped field, across a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
roadway, between fence posts and were
ushered into a long, low building, one of
many such that faced an exceedingly wide
street fully a quarter of a mile long. Parallel
to this ran other streets flanked by similar
but smaller buildings, all of them being but
one story high, with slightly sloping roofs.</p>

<p>There was something plain, strong, durable
and altogether business-like about this newly
made little city that spoke of utility only,
without frills or any effort at useless show.</p>

<p>The only thing of beauty to be seen anywhere
near was the glorious Stars and Stripes
floating from the peaks of many of the buildings;
by far the largest flag waved in the soft
early summer breeze from a great iron flagpole
near the entrance end of the main camp
street.</p>

<p>Two trim figures in khaki uniforms and
leather puttees came and stood near the boys
and conversed audibly.</p>

<p>"Quite a likely bunch of rookies this time,"
said one.</p>

<p>"Guess they'll get some material out of
them, old and young. These two here are
just kids."</p>

<p>"Look like promising chaps, though.
Wonder when the adjutant and Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Fraley are going to get busy. And then&mdash;say!
It's going to be some fun breaking in
all these new men. Well, there's two things
they didn't have to teach <i>me</i>&mdash;that's how to
sleep and to have an appetite! Me for the
mess whenever they toot!"</p>

<p>"Here, too! There's one thing, though,
haven't you noticed, that the boys are generally
deficient in? That's shooting. I
think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That we ought to practise more? Sure.
And we ought to have better instructors;
not men who know it theoretically, but fellows
that can actually show some skill.
Lieutenant Merrill can't hit a barn door;
saw him try. Score was rotten. Then trying
to show us how! I spoke to the captain about
that and he said he was going to take it up
with the colonel and he will tackle the general,
I suppose. Cap said many of the men were
complaining and wanted to get practice."</p>

<p>Roy had been listening intently to this
colloquy and now he stepped forward and
saluted.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, but do you think the very
best shot in the United States of America
would be in demand, then, here?"</p>

<p>The two soldiers laughed and one said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you the champion rifle&mdash;-?"</p>

<p>"Not I. But my friend here is all o' that.
He can beat the chump who invented the
gun. Take it from me, he can 'most knock
the eye out of a mosquito at a hundred&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, cut the comedy, old man!" Herb
shouted. "They send a man to the guard-house
here for less. We've got to learn more
than how to shoot."</p>

<p>"Right; you do!" answered one of the
soldiers, making a quick and evidently satisfactory
appraisal of Herbert. "But we don't
have a guard-house here; remember that.
We go on the honor system. As soon as you
fellows get assigned and get your uniforms,
which'll take some little time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have a letter here for the commanding
general that I'll bet he'll be dyin' to read!"
declared Roy quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, then, you'd better go to headquarters
first of all. See that low building with the
people sitting outside? Tell one of the aides
there who you are; he'll fix you."</p>

<p>The Brighton lads were a little surprised
and much pleased with the almost sudden
absence of red tape. In a short time they
confronted the camp commander and that
personage proved to be far more kindly than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
his rather severe appearance and abrupt
manner indicated. He seemed to take an
especial interest in the boys, spoke to them
briefly of their school and home life, uttered a
short, though heartfelt "Too bad!" when
learning that Herbert was an orphan and after
an order to an aide respecting the two ended
with:</p>

<p>"You shall be enrolled at once and placed,
boys. There is much for you to learn. I
will keep you both in mind and a little later
on I want to witness your skill at shooting.
We have too little ability here in that art."</p>

<p>The "little later" proved to be long over a
month, in which time both boys had become
privates in Company H, Officers' Corps, as
far as the simpler requirements of knowing
how to obey commands could take them.
But they had soon learned that Camp Wheeler
was partly an officers' training camp; that
they had to study and practise and drill and
listen to lectures and practise some more and
study some more for many, many hours each
day and that they were always ready for the
wholesome, plentiful food and the comfortable
cot at night, finding the enforced silence,
after taps were sounded, not a whit unreasonable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>There was some little time off and then
leave on Sundays when the boys, sometimes
with others of their company, or more often
by themselves, walked to the mile-distant
town and bought sweets, knicknacks, ice
cream, sundaes and other toothsome articles
of the kind, craving a little novelty after the
rather plain diet of the camp. Some there
were who craved a little more than novelty
and who sought it in ways that the law of
neither town nor camp permitted. For it
was known that the section around camp was,
so-called, "dry."</p>

<p>Then Captain Leighton of Company H, as
did all the others in command of such units,
give the boys a little talk.</p>

<p>"You men," he said, "have the Y. M. C. A.
and the Knights of Columbus as refining elements
and spiritual aids. You have your
chaplain, who is strong in sympathy and
noble in precept. Above all, you have your
integrity, your consciences, your pleasure in
clean living as reminders of what is necessary
in the conduct of an officer and a gentleman.
Of this we have spoken before and also of
that which is down deep in your hearts,
sterling patriotism and the desire to win this
war. And this does not mean drilling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
discipline and method only. It means clean
living; it does not expect of you only bravery,
courage to face a foe, but manliness in every
way. We all hope not only for good conduct
in ourselves, but also to teach it by word and
example to others. This all is the test of
patriotism of a practical, battle-winning kind.</p>

<p>"Our general has requested those of us
now in command of you, as you later will be
in command, to talk to you about these matters
and particularly in relation to the tendency
to obtain and partake of intoxicants.
Liquor is a trouble bringer, a brain stealer, a
disgusting habit maker and you want to get
away from it as you would from a German
with a bayonet, killing it first, however, with
your moral automatic. And now, I want all
of you who favor these sentiments to respond
with three rousing cheers for Lieutenant
Total Abstinence. Are you ready? Hip,
hip&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The chorus of approval rang out with no
uncertain sound; it seemed to be unanimous,
beyond a doubt. But Herbert noticed,
glancing once around, that here and there
some of the fellows expressed in their faces
that they were not in accord with the prevailing
opinion. They had in some way been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
adversely prejudiced; perhaps were the sons
of saloon keepers, brewers or distillers; perhaps
had come from homes where unthinking
parents had admitted the stuff to sideboard
and table.</p>

<p>Among these dissenters was one Martin
Gaul, a dark-skinned son of foreign parentage.
He was morose, stubborn, and much
inclined to be quarrelsome. Almost upon
first acquaintance he had shown a marked
and exceedingly unjust antagonism toward
Roy. With Herbert, on the other hand, he
had an inclination to be unduly friendly,
even to the extent of toadying. But Herbert,
ever loyal to his chum, treated this with cold
disdain or deserved sarcasm.</p>

<p>Returning from the town one Sunday
evening, the two boys overtook three others
in khaki walking slowly ahead of them.
One was talking loudly, with much unnecessary
laughter; the others were grumbling,
evidently disposed to disagree about something;
one surely had a very decided grouch.</p>

<p>Herb nudged Roy. "Gaul ahead there,"
he said, "and Phillips. I wonder that Billy
mixes in with that chump. Who's the other
fellow?"</p>

<p>"Not of Company H. Some other bad egg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
from another bit of the alphabet," Roy
remarked. "Come on, let's steer a course to
leeward of them; the sidewalk mebbe can
stand it."</p>

<p>"No, let's hang back a minute; or cross
the street. Gaul's in a mood, I take it, to
start a quarrel with you. I think they've
all been drinking."</p>

<p>But walk as slowly as they did, they could
hardly help drawing nearer, and then suddenly
Herbert, though having just counseled
prudence in his friend, darted forward and
seized an object held up between Gaul and
young Billy Phillips. Too much of this
passing had made the trio careless of
discovery.</p>

<p>Phillips ducked and dodged clumsily, as
though expecting seizure himself, but Gaul
turned fiercely to confront Herbert, the half-emptied
whisky bottle gripped in the latter's
hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, you! Now that ain't a very nice
trick to play on a fellow, unless you want a
pull at it yourself. In that case you're most
welcome, old top."</p>

<p>Herb did not reply to Gaul, but addressed
Phillips: "Billy, you're a blamed fool to
disobey orders in this way and go against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
common sense and decency. You know
you're not that kind of a chap, in the first
place. Time to cut it out."</p>

<p>Roy Flynn took a hand in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Birds of a feather do not always flock
together, it would seem," he said. "At
least, not in your case, Phillips. Evil associations
gather no moss and a rolling stone
corrupts good manners. You ought to know
that, me lad."</p>

<p>"Are you meaning to sling any insults by
that?" Gaul suddenly exploded. "Mebbe
you want a slam on the jaw, which you're
liable to get!"</p>

<p>"Never a bit! But I reckon you're electioneering
to elect trouble."</p>

<p>"You can't make no trouble for me, you
red-headed Mick! I think I'll just take a
fall out o' you, anyway." Saying which
Gaul advanced upon Roy.</p>

<p>"You're on, me lad," was Flynn's rejoinder.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Fight for the Right</span></p>


<p>"I want to warn you fellows," said
Herb, stepping between the would-be
combatants, "that this sort of thing is
not what our officers would approve of. You
have no reason to scrap, except a mutual
dislike. Better agree to disagree. Shake
hands and call it off."</p>

<p>"Shake? Not with that thing!" cried
Gaul, and Roy vigorously shook his head.
There was positive joy in the lad's face and
voice.</p>

<p>"The only use I'll make o' me hands now
is quite different," he laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, then; go at it," said Herb, and
in a low voice to Roy: "Get his wind first;
then smash him."</p>

<p>The battle was short, sharp, and at first
terrific on the part of Gaul. His style of
fighting consisted in rapid rushes, swings and
slams, if he could clinch, in the hope to conquer
at once.</p>

<p>Roy, as quick on his feet as a cat, had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
difficulty in avoiding his heavier opponent
until the latter was partly winded; then
suddenly Gaul got two awful whacks on the
solar plexus that further deprived him of
needed oxygen so that he staggered. In that
instant's failure to come back Gaul got one
big wallop, a right-handed, body-plunging
swing fair on the side of his jaw and he was
not even aware that the sidewalk flew up and
all but embraced him.</p>

<p>Herb, Billy Phillips and the other fellow
picked Gaul up and tried to stand him on his
feet, Billy jocosely counting ten quite slowly.
Gaul presently opened his eyes and used his
legs, then sat down on the bank bordering the
open lots. Roy was far aside, using his
handkerchief to bind up his skinned knuckles.
Then Herb spoke:</p>

<p>"We're not going to report you fellows;
we're not squealers. But you know this
boozing isn't a square deal; Billy, you know
that, after what has been said to us. The
stuff's no good. What real fun can you see in
getting half soused and having everyone else
wise to it? You ought to have more sense."</p>

<p>"Doggone it, Herb, I have, and I'm going
to give it the go-by! Owe it to you fellows,
too. Never again for me! I don't know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
about Gaul, but I don't think Williams
here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned, but the said Williams was walking
rapidly away and they took that for a
pretty good sign, or at least shame for his
act. Billy added:</p>

<p>"He's a good chap and you've got his
goat. Bet he cuts the booze, too. How
about you, Gaul?"</p>

<p>The fellow was himself now, but sore mentally
and physically, and he made no reply.
Phillips told him to come on, but he sat still,
mumbling and thus they left him, Herb tossing
the whisky bottle so that it smashed to
pieces at Gaul's feet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning, after drill and practice,
Herbert was much surprised and not a little
bothered in mind to receive word from Corporal
Grant of his squad that the captain
wished to see Private Whitcomb. The boy
surmised the reason and he did not wish to
bear tales.</p>

<p>His worry was added to when Captain
Leighton, saluting gravely, bade him follow
and led the way across the street to headquarters.
In a moment they stood before
the commander's desk, and the general looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
up with his customary cold stare, which suddenly
changed to surprise.</p>

<p>"This man boozing&mdash;&mdash;?" he began.</p>

<p>"No, no, sir! Quite the reverse. He
broke it up. Private Phillips, and Williams,
of Company D, are the ones who confessed
that they went to town and got some liquor."</p>

<p>"Yes. Speak-easy. We have notified the
authorities and they will arrest the parties;
if not, we shall send a squad and raid all
doubtful places. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This man Whitcomb, General&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember him."</p>

<p>"Well, he took their bottle away and
smashed it and talked Phillips and Williams
into good behavior. I get it also from Phillips
that Private Flynn was in some kind of a
fight over it, Flynn also being against booze,
but I can't learn the name of the other fellow;
possibly they don't know him."</p>

<p>"Know him, Whitcomb?" General Harding
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes-es, I&mdash;do." Herb hesitated. "But
I'd rather not name him, sir. Flynn licked
him awfully and I have a notion he was pretty
well punished and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We ought to be the best judges of that.
But no doubt you are right." The general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
arose and reached out his hand to Herbert.
"You did a good thing, my boy, and deserve
the gratitude of the camp. It was no small
thing to do. If you were not so young I
would recommend you to your colonel for a
non-com appointment, but as it is I have my
eye on you in another capacity. Expert
with a gun, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, sir. I&mdash;&mdash;, but please
remember Flynn also."</p>

<p>"We are going after you fellows later and
I'll remember you both. Thanks for your
stand in this booze business."</p>

<p>But Herbert was not greatly elated over
this incident; he considered that he had only
done a simple duty, without playing at
heroism, and it was merely carrying out his
convictions to the letter. He regretted that
Roy had not shared with him in being personally
honored by the commander's approval,
but Roy declared he had taken no part, except
in fisticuffs.</p>

<p>However, another circumstance, a few days
later, put a feather in the cap of each boy.
It was a very different matter, indeed, in
which they figured.</p>

<p>"Patriotism, to be worth while," their
captain had said in one of his talks to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
company in barracks, "must be of practical
value and not consist in the mere waving of
flags and cheering. The true patriot is willing
at all times to do something for his country,
to defend her against detractors, to fight
her battles.</p>

<p>"There is among our alien inhabitants
throughout the land a treachery that is in
league with our foes and this is making itself
felt in so many ways, is trying to influence so
many people who have to do with our war
preparations that it is difficult to say where,
when, and how it may crop out. It has even
dared, snake-like, to rear its ugly and venomous
head in or near our military camps, and
all the watching in the world does not seem to
keep it down nor stamp it out entirely. I
only mention this to caution you against
it whenever encountered, just as you should
be cautioned against rattlesnakes in the
mountains or sharks when swimming in
tropic waters."</p>

<p>There came to the town, occupying hotels,
cottages, empty school buildings, halls and
specially erected shacks, a Woman's Social
Betterment League from somewhere, fraternizing
with an organization of the kind
in the town and directing its very laudable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
efforts toward making life more enjoyable
for the soldiers.</p>

<p>There were those who said it was made
up largely of faddists, well-to-do women and
their followers who were looking for something
new and amusing, but this was not
entirely the truth. Others said that the
camps had too much of the "betterment
business," but the Woman's League workers
did not preach; they exerted only an insistent,
healthy influence.</p>

<p>Most of the inhabitants of Camp Wheeler,
even largely the officers, fell for this sort of
treatment when on leave; and among them,
in time, were Herb Whitcomb and Roy Flynn.</p>

<p>The League gave several dinners and most
properly conducted dances, the invitations
being nicely managed so as to include everyone
in turn. One Saturday afternoon the
two Brighton boys were booked for a tennis
tournament against several couples picked
from other companies.</p>

<p>Herb never did find out how they were
chosen to represent their company, nor would
Roy admit that it had been his doings. The
latter could play a fine game himself, but he
very justly lauded his chum.</p>

<p>Herb's service was superb, his returns were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
nearly all well placed smashes, his net play
was a revelation to most of the onlookers.
Company H took the first prize easily and a
young and blushing girl, standing by the
general, tendered it to Herb and Roy, the
latter looking right at her with a wide but
most respectful grin. Herb did not know
even what she looked like; he knew she was
a girl only by the toe of her boot and all he
heard was the final comment of the general.</p>

<p>"Fine work, my boy! I used to be pretty
good at tennis myself. Had the honor of
playing with Colonel Roosevelt once when he
was in the White House. Remember, lad,
I have my eye on you. If you can shoot
half as good as you can get a ball over the
net&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Much better, sir; much better!" struck
in Roy, and the commander smiled and
waved his hand, the crowd cheered and an
orchestra struck up some popular selections.</p>

<p>Following this Herb and Roy found themselves
invited to a private affair on a Sunday
afternoon, along with four other rookies. On
the Saturday preceding the event the six
were ordered to report to regimental
headquarters.</p>

<p>They filed in, saluting Colonel Walling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
who looked them over closely, then began
asking questions as to their families, bringing
up, school life and teachings and present
ideas, though not one of them knew what it
was all about. It proved to be a rather
solemn occasion until the questions came to
Roy Flynn. That lad needed no prompting,
having caught the drift from the previous
questions.</p>

<p>"If me name is Flynn, sir, I'm neither
Dutch, French nor Italian, and though me
folks is Hibernian and so emerald green that a
shamrock looks like a blue daisy alongside,
don't believe nothin' else but what I'm so
high-pressure American that the sky above has
nothin' on me for true blue. I want most of
all in this world to get to the happy hunting-ground
in the next, but close second to that
is the wish to see the Germans get it in the
windpipe, proper and right. Do ye get me,
sir?"</p>

<p>Colonel Walling had to laugh; being part
and proudly Irish himself, he must have
appreciated the lad's manner and remarks.
Then he asked some questions of one other
man, a young corporal in Company A, and
running his eye over the bunch was about
to indicate to Lieutenant Spaulding to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
this man aside when in came Brigadier-General
Harding.</p>

<p>There was a moment's conference between
the two officers. The commander's cold
eyes scanned the crowd, but warmed a little
when he caught sight of Whitcomb. Then,
after a short consultation, Captain Leighton
was called forward. Herb also was asked to
advance and he heard the colonel say:</p>

<p>"Give them a broad hint; make them
understand the possible situation. They
must only keep their eyes open and keep
mum."</p>

<p>The general added quickly.</p>

<p>"Better confine this to Whitcomb only;
he'll know how far to include Flynn. We
can trust them both, I think, but depend
most wisely on Whitcomb. Eh, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Why, I hope so, whatever it is," Herb
replied, turning very red.</p>

<p>They were all dismissed, Herbert being
asked to accompany Captain Leighton. In
a quiet corner of the barracks, which was his
office, he gave the boy these brief orders:</p>

<p>"We suspect there is something wrong at
Mrs. Thompson's, where you are invited to
dinner. She was, we find, before her marriage,
a Miss Heinig and we believe she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
not born in this country. You might guess
where, though we do not actually know.
However, we want you to keep your ears open
and use your wits and we trust you; the general,
you may have observed, picked you out
from the others for this duty. Flynn is going
along; you may put him partly wise, if you
like, but we think not altogether at first.
Just give him some hints to stand in with
you when called on, if you need him at all.
Now, there may be some sharp brain work
necessary, also the necessity of fully keeping
your head under trying conditions. Are you
at all fond of the girls?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Herb. "Don't know anything
about them. They're nice enough, I
dare say; fine, in fact, to be sure, but you see
I've always been an out-of-doors kid and
something of a student and I'm only a boy
yet. I respect girls, of course, because my
mother was one once and I like to remember
her as quite angelic. I think she must be an
angel now. She's dead."</p>

<p>The captain leaned over and put his hand
on the boy's shoulder and for a moment the
two were not superior officer and private;
they were man to man in genuine sympathy.</p>

<p>"My own case, too, my boy. I know just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
how you feel." He paused. "But to come
back to the matter in hand. We can believe,
with good reason, that most women are fine.
There are some, however, that are treacherous,
scheming, dishonest; outward show and
charming manners do not always hide this
fully. You will be up against something of
this to-morrow, perhaps. Now, if anything
transpires that is not all right in your estimation
and you can fully handle it yourself,
simply call your companions together&mdash;they
merely have orders to act as a squad if called
on and to take orders from you. But if you
are at all doubtful about taking action just
call me up; I believe the cottage has a
'phone."</p>

<p>"But what will there be&mdash;&mdash;?" began
Herb. The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"We think it best not to tell you all; it
may cause you to act hastily and you may
find out nothing. Only just be on the lookout,
with your ears mostly."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Delicate Mission</span></p>


<p>It was a flower-decorated and most attractive
dining-room into which the six young
men were ushered after being most graciously
received by Mrs. Thompson. There
was a promise, indeed, of good things in the
eating line to come and nothing could have
been more gratifying to healthy youths who
had long been absent from home cooking and
daintily served luxuries, no matter how well
fed they were with plain and nutritive stuff.</p>

<p>And then, as the boys stood for a moment
by their chairs in imitation of their hostess,
somewhere at a distance in the house soft
music began to play. Suddenly the lady
clapped her hands, the double doors leading
to the hall flew open and six smiling young
girls, dressed in pink and white and with
flowing ribbons, entered.</p>

<p>Rapid introductions followed, the younger
lads, and especially Herbert, being somewhat
awkward in acknowledgment; to say that all
were taken aback, though some agreeably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
surprised, was no exaggeration. As the genial
hostess was busily engaged in wisely seating
her guests, it was Roy Flynn's ready tongue
that put all at ease. Addressing Mrs. Thompson
and with a wave of his hand, he said:</p>

<p>"Faith, me dear lady, it's the princess ye
are at furnishin' delights, and all of us ought
to agree with me. As me old granddad used
to say, 'Bad cest to the lad who don't admire
the lasses,' though ye might guess that hits
me friend here, Mr. Whitcomb."</p>

<p>More the manner than the words caused a
laugh and a flutter. A tall, dark-haired,
pretty damsel, Mrs. Thompson's elder daughter,
who proved to be a great aid to her mother
in leading the general conversation, from her
seat by Corporal Hern waved her finger tips
across the table at Roy.</p>

<p>"Oh, you say that so nicely. But we shall
try to keep Mr. Whitcomb from running
away, though there is, of course, no telling
what any of you terrible warriors may take
it into your heads to do."</p>

<p>Roy arose and made a profound bow to the
girl and struck an attitude.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Flowers by the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Buds at the table,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joy over all,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Eat while you're able."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></div></div>

<p>He shot this off exactly as though he had
committed it to memory. It began, then, to
appear that the red-haired, homely lad would
surely become the lion of the evening, for all
the girls and most of the boys, themselves
short in wit, appealed to Roy for a characterization
of this or that thing rapidly discussed.
And Roy was ever ready, so that the laughter
and gaiety made the dinner a pronounced
success.</p>

<p>Throughout this effusiveness, though appreciative
of the wit and repartee, Herb sat almost
silent and observant, though as yet ignorant
of what he was particularly to observe. He
was near the middle of one side of the table
and by him sat the younger of Mrs. Thompson's
daughters, an over-fat, giggling girl,
slow of speech and evidently lax in ideas.
She had been addressed as Laura. Rose and
she were no more alike than a slice of ham
and an ice cream cone.</p>

<p>Evidently Herb was expected to make
himself agreeable to Laura Thompson, judging
by the girl's manner, and the pink-flounced
creature on the other side of him was all
smiles and giggles for Terry Newlin, from
Company I.</p>

<p>As the guests became more and more filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
with good things and the hours grew longer
the talk and laughter fell off a little, even
Roy growing less verbose. Presently Rose
Thompson, following a glance from her
mother, made the request:</p>

<p>"Now, you boys might tell us something
about your life and duties in camp. Mr.
Hern, you're a non-com and in command
here, of course, you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; you see, we are off duty," replied
the complaisant corporal, "and there is no
need for leadership here. But if we should
need to be commanded in any way, why,
then, Whitcomb over there is to have the
say."</p>

<p>There was a rapid change of glances between
Rose and her mother, the latter making a
quick signal with her eyes. Almost instantly
Rose called to Laura:</p>

<p>"Say, kid, the corporal here wants to get
better acquainted with you, I know. He
said he admires stout girls most&mdash;surely you
said that, corporal. Besides, I am just
dying to talk with Mr. Whitcomb."</p>

<p>"Herb's scared to death already, so don't
make him breathe his last quite yet, Miss
Thompson," Roy demanded. He would have
said this more hilariously, seeing Herb's face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
turn red, but something in the look his chum
gave him shut him up. This also was not lost
on Mrs. Thompson's elder daughter.</p>

<p>The sisters exchanged places and at once
Rose Thompson set about making herself
more than agreeable to Herb. She was
plainly bent upon drawing him out of his
shell, was apparently determined to discover
his brighter side. And the lad, always gentle
and polite, unbent so far as to laugh and
reply in kind to her sallies, but he did not lose
one word being said by the hostess. Presently
that lady echoed her daughter's recent
request for camp news, doings and methods.</p>

<p>Terry Newlin was almost as ready as Roy
Flynn; indeed, he talked more, but really
said less. And he never thought twice what
it was best for him to say. Now, pleased to
hold the attention of all the fair ones, he
began to spout upon the subject in hand.
He rattled away about the grub, the cots, the
drill, the study, the officers; and presently,
surer of sympathetic hearing, began to enlarge
upon the complaints, as he himself viewed
them.</p>

<p>Rose Thompson saw that Herbert was
trying to catch Terry's eye and she at once
strove to prevent his doing so, for it was evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
that the trend that Terry had taken
much pleased the hostess. But Herb was
not to be denied. He glanced across to Roy,
pointed his thumb at Terry and his finger
down and shook his head; then leveled a
finger at Roy and another finger upward and
nodded. Roy, never lacking, caught the
drift.</p>

<p>"Oh, box the corpse, Terry, and have the
funeral over! Nobody's got any kick comin'
at camp, and you know it! Why, company
quarters are as good as home and no pig in the
parlor nor hen nestin' in the bread-box, as
Terry's been used to. Whurrah, lad! Ye
give us all the blues!"</p>

<p>This silenced Terry, but not Mrs. Thompson.
That diplomatic person saw the crucial
moment was at hand to embark the spirit of
discontent, and, looking her sweetest, she at
once held the attention of the guests.</p>

<p>"But camp life must be really very crude,
very uncomfy, very lonely, uninteresting and
disconsolate, as Mr. Newlin has intimated.
I can believe you are, most of you, actually
homesick when you think of the real differences
between camp and home, cold-blooded
officers and mother love, plain fare and
dainties, and all that. Now, isn't that so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>A half audible assent from the girls went
around the table. That kind of leaven was
sure to work wonders. The boys listened as
the hostess continued:</p>

<p>"And it does seem a truly terrible thing
that all this hardship, all this preparation,
all this loss of time from studies, business,
worthy pleasures at home should be thought
necessary when there is really so little to be
gained. Am I not right? All for death or
loss of means, or both, for being maimed for
life, made blind, made a dependent."</p>

<p>She paused impressively to let that sink in
and another acquiescent sigh escaped, Herb
noting with surprise that some of the boys
joined in this, particularly Terry Newlin.</p>

<p>"And then," Mrs. Thompson continued,
"what do we gain? What is it all for? Do
we need to fear any European power away
over here after this terrible war is over?
Except England! Very probably England,
who will fight always and against everything
for commercial supremacy and her control of
the seas. Are we not now fighting England's
battles, and how will she thank us?</p>

<p>"You poor boys away off there in those
awful trenches, wallowing in mud, sleeping
on straw, covered with vermin, with the din<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of bursting shells in your ears, the horrid
expectation of death continually, seeing your
loved comrades cut down, horribly wounded,
dying or killed outright, your mind and body
constantly suffering from these&mdash;surely you
cannot disagree&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This last, in her most engaging manner,
was addressed to Roy Flynn. The lad had
risen and leaning forward, with both fists
on the table, was glaring at the woman savagely;
all the jollity in his round, red face had
suddenly fled.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to try to make slackers of
us; to preach the doctrine of discontent?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Not at all, my dear boy.
You quite misunderstand me, I am sure.
Nothing could be more foreign to my thoughts.
I am only deeply filled with sympathy for
the lads who are going away to fight our
battles, to bleed and die for us, while we, as
it seems most selfishly, remain here in peace
and security at home, able to do so little.
And all for so little gain, probably for no gain
at all. Our country is confronted by such a
gigantic task. On us, soon, will fall the
brunt of the effort to oppose the greatest
military power on earth, and what can&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>She paused a moment, noting Herbert's
quick glance and apparent signal to Roy,
who instantly resumed his seat, but refrained
from again adopting his jovial manner and
speech.</p>

<p>"You see," Mrs. Thompson went on, "the
Germans are so wonderfully able, are such a
thoroughly capable race that it is well-nigh
impossible to equal them in anything.
They&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herbert decided that he must at last get
into the conversation.</p>

<p>"Why do you so highly praise the Germans?"
he asked abruptly. "We Americans
refuse to believe that they are such wonderfully
capable people. They are awful brags
and try to make the rest of the world think
they are the top notch of mankind, but in
what way they show it I can't see.</p>

<p>"Young man, you are evidently not fully
informed. You have not been in Germany,
as I have. The German people are the most
efficient&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No people are efficient who set the whole
world against them," interrupted Herb.</p>

<p>"Mere jealousy on the part of other
nations!" scoffed the lady. "But anyway,
whatever you may think of the Germans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
this fact remains: they have not invaded
our country to war on us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only because they couldn't," interposed
Roy.</p>

<p>"They have not injured any of our
people&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! How about the <i>Lusitania</i> and some
other boats?" chimed in Anthony Wayne
Bartlett-Smith.</p>

<p>"Merely the fortunes of war as aimed at
another country. Americans had no business
to be on that boat when they had already been
warned. How could the submarines choose
between&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Will you pardon me," Herbert suddenly
requested, "for asking to be excused for a few
moments so that I may call up our captain to
ask at what hour we are to return? May I
use your 'phone?"</p>

<p>The boy had arrived at a rapid conclusion,
believing that drastic measures should be
adopted. Half-way methods were distasteful
to him. He was not certain that he had
sufficient grounds for action, but anyway,
that would be up to Captain Leighton. No
doubt Herb could have the rest of the soldier
guests with him, all except Terry Newlin,
who seemed to be naturally disgruntled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The bland face of the hostess went suddenly
red and then very white, but she indicated
the front hallway where the telephone
hung. Then, as Herb arose, both he and Roy
noticed that the lady nodded her head toward
her elder daughter, who quickly got up and
followed Herbert through the archway.</p>

<p>As the boy reached his hand for the instrument
there was a quick step beside him and
slender fingers were thrust forward to push
his hand aside.</p>

<p>"May I ask for what purpose, really,
are you going to 'phone?" Rose
Thompson asked.</p>

<p>"I told your mother what for, didn't I?"
Herb replied.</p>

<p>"I know; yes. But your real reason?"</p>

<p>"Great Jehoshaphat! If you don't want
me to use it I can get one next door, perhaps,
or somewhere."</p>

<p>"No; use this one. But I have asked you
a question. Now please answer. I want to
know very much, indeed, and I know you will
not refuse me."</p>

<p>"Won't I? There must be many a thing
that you want to know right badly and
can't. Well, I will use your 'phone as it's
getting late." He had glanced at the hall
clock.</p>

<p>"That clock is fast, very!" the girl declared.
"And I must know. I must!"</p>

<p>She had interposed herself between Herbert
and the 'phone and she looked very determined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a><br /><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
It was not a pleasing position for
the boy to be in, opposed by a gentle-appearing
girl. Many a chap, even less tender-hearted
than he, would have turned away,
hoping for some other way to proceed, but
Herb saw his duty first and clearly, the girl's
attitude making him the more determined.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Miss Thompson, you can
hear me talk, can't you? I don't like to
scrap with women, but I know my orders.
Come, let me have that 'phone, or I'll have to
take it, anyway."</p>

<p>She had put her hand against his breast
and held him back. "When you tell me."</p>

<p>"To see when we are to return, I said.
The captain told me to call him up about it."</p>

<p>"But that is not all. Tell me." Evidently
she was playing for time.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! Let me have that 'phone."
And with a quick dive past her he did get it,
and though she caught the cord and pulled it
violently once, he held receiver and mouth-piece
firmly in place.</p>

<p>"Give me the camp, please; Company H
Barracks. Yes.&mdash;Captain Leighton? Whitcomb.&mdash;Return
when?&mdash;Yes, we're all here.&mdash;It
was indeed a dandy dinner!&mdash;I understand.&mdash;Yes.&mdash;Right
away.&mdash;All right." He
hung up the receiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose now, you are satisfied, Miss
Thompson."</p>

<p>The girl hesitated a moment, thinking,
staring at him. "I think I am. And I
think you are anything but a gentleman!"
Suddenly she darted forward and dashed into
the dining-room, Herb following with long
strides.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The hostess gave Herbert a look of such
mingled hate and fear that had he been less
immune would have turned him cold. She
struck the table bell and turned toward the
kitchen door. It opened to admit only a
broad, very blonde face.</p>

<p>"Gretchen, you know my orders! At once;
then remain! Laura, our hats and dusters!
Rose, the suitcases are ready!"</p>

<p>Herbert knew that Rose had seen through
his message and he surmised at once that all
this had been planned ahead with German
thoroughness, in case of failure to entirely
convince all the guests. Perhaps it was the
woman's first attempt at sowing discontent
among the soldiers; perhaps the first of any
of such bold attempts.</p>

<p>He saw that, with a good start in the powerful
car which they had, the Thompsons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
could get over the State line and thus avoid
immediate detention; possibly then go in
hiding for a time and give the government
authorities no end of trouble later.</p>

<p>Perhaps the authorities would not even
wish to detain the woman, but at any rate
the boy resolved to see to it that Captain
Leighton could come into touch with the
situation, first hand.</p>

<p>To carry out this determination there was
but one logical thing to do and to do quickly.</p>

<p>Herbert stood in the archway as Rose and
Laura faced him. His service revolver, all
the while in its holster under his coat, now was
in his hand.</p>

<p>"The first person, except as ordered, who
makes even an attempt to leave or enter
this room will be shot; man or woman!
Flynn, slip out and tell the servants this;
then go watch for Captain Leighton, who will
soon be here! The Thompson car, Bartlett;
you go out and hold that! Newlin, you remain
where you are; perhaps the captain may
want to question you! You other fellows, go
out of each of those other doors and lock
them outside; then wait for the captain!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson sank into a chair, her
eyes, in fear, glaring at Herbert. Laura, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
tears, knelt by her. Two of the other girls
sat weakly at the table, one with her face in
her hands; the other two, clasped in each
other's arms, stood in a far corner. But
Rose Thompson fearlessly faced Herbert, her
head thrown back, her arms stretched down,
her fists clenched, in precisely the most
approved dramatic attitude for the occasion.
And the boy had one fleeting thought that
he had never seen a human face more to be
admired.</p>

<p>"This is a nice return for our hospitality!
I think I could kill you!"</p>

<p>"Don't do it, please." He smiled. "I
want to get a whack at your dear friends
over in Germany first."</p>

<p>"Huh! They'll eat you up!" Rose retorted.
"They'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are not our friends&mdash;&mdash;" wailed
Mrs. Thompson, who was evidently not
equal to this phase of the situation.</p>

<p>"Mother, hush! Don't be a coward!
And don't lie! What if they are? We have a
right to do as we please. Have what friends
we wish. You coward, to threaten women!"
she suddenly flashed out at Herbert. "But,
pshaw! I'm not afraid of you. And I am
going out that door! We all are! This is
our house! Stand aside! Do you hear?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Herbert merely shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm going out, I tell you! You won't
dare to shoot! Poof! I'm not afraid of you,
I guess! You would not dare to threaten
men this way! But women&mdash;oh, you think
you're very safe! Come, let me pass!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Miss Thompson, if you think
I like this business, you get another think.
But I know my duty just the same. And,
honestly, you won't look half as nice laid out
in a coffin, not even with a million flowers, as
you do now. So don't tempt me to use this
gun, for I will if you get gay!"</p>

<p>"I dare you!" the girl shouted.</p>

<p>"Well, if you really want to see how it
feels to have a bullet go plowing through
your anatomy, just make a dive for that
doorway. Go ahead and try it." With a
hand that wavered not in the least he leveled
the pistol barrel straight at her. For one
moment the girl stood irresolute, bravely
weighing the chances. Then a wail from her
mother and a cry of alarm from one of the
other girls who thought she was going to
start checked her. She stepped back and
sank into a chair.</p>

<p>There came the opening and slamming of
the front door, heavy footfalls, and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Leighton, with a sergeant and two men,
entered the room, saluting.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes the captain had heard
Herbert's story, listened to Rose Thompson's
impassioned admissions and Mrs. Thompson's
weak effort at defense, and had disposed of
the matter.</p>

<p>"General Harding is away and I am ordered
to take care of this case. Good work on your
part, Whitcomb. We have suspected Mrs.
Thompson, <i>née</i> Heinig, of duplicity before.
In the pay of German agents, no doubt.
Well, Mrs. Thompson, we don't care to war
on women. We can advise you, however, to
cut out this sort of thing; or later, as certain
as death, it will mean a long prison sentence.
You will be closely watched from this on.
You may go free now, but must break up and
leave here at once. I have no doubt the
State Department would recommend you for
passports through Holland, if you would like
to return to Germany and we surely would
be glad to have you go. Now, men, all fall
in and we shall return to camp."</p>

<p>As Herb passed out he summoned one more
spark of courage to address Rose Thompson,
who was glaring at him.</p>

<p>"You have your nerve, all right, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
just quite enough. If you had slipped out I
wouldn't have shot at you for ten billion
dollars. Good-by, and give my love to
Kaiser Bill; I may get the chance to shoot at
him some day and I'll do that!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Camp life went along the same routine:
drill and practise and study. Herbert and
Roy heard nothing more about the dinner
incident, except that the captain once told
Sergeant Jenkins who told Corporal Hern
who told Roy that Mrs. Thompson and her
daughters had, indeed, sailed for the other
side, to what part and ultimate destination
were not known.</p>

<p>Just prior to drill one morning Captain
Leighton sent for Herbert.</p>

<p>"I want you to keep this under your hat,"
he said. "There is a call for expert shots
to form several snipers' platoons, or perhaps
companies, as yet uncertain as to numbers.
Other camps are trying out men and we have
picked some few here. The general remembers
you as having been recommended in this
particular and I am to try you out. You are
excused from drill, so report at the range in
half an hour."</p>

<p>"How about Flynn? He can shoot,"
Herb said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can? Tell Lieutenant Mitchell to excuse
Flynn from drill also. We'll find out what
you boys can do."</p>

<p>The Brighton lads naturally thought this
would be a simple test of their own shooting
before the captain only, but when they crossed
the field to the meadow that faced the wide
targets and pits they saw a dozen men already
there and soon discerned several officers and
the commander himself. As they stepped
up to the group and saluted, General Harding
greeted Herb and Roy almost jocosely.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ready to bat some more balls over
the net, eh, Whitcomb? I hear you made
some rapid returns and good placement shots
down at Mrs. Thompson's not long ago.
Now we are going to find out if you can really
shoot as well as you play tennis."</p>

<p>The boys observed that all the other marksmen
were lying flat, some with head, some
with feet toward the target and they were
seeking every means to rest their rifles steadily,
to set telescope sights just so, to get
their elevations of rear sight perfectly and
then to delay shooting until satisfied as to
every condition.</p>

<p>Herb was assigned a place and a target at
two hundred yards; just behind him stood a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
flagman. The boy requested the latter to
signal to the marker not to touch the target
until he had fired ten shots, and this was
done.</p>

<p>Tallied scores were being shown the officers,
and they paid very little attention to any one
in particular. But Roy, standing back of
Herb, said:</p>

<p>"The general keeps looking this way; got
his eye on you, me boy. There goes your
fresh target up; now give it to her! With
that size bull's-eye it's a cinch."</p>

<p>Herb brought his gun to his shoulder and,
standing, fired five shots in rapid succession,
hardly four seconds apart. Then, slipping in
another clip, he repeated even a little more
quickly. After a few moments a big letter
"P" was shoved up in front of the target, the
marker, evidently having some difficulty in
finding it, as perfect scores were indeed a
rarity, even on a twelve-inch bull's-eye.</p>

<p>"Here comes the general and the whole
bunch almost on a trot. The old man saw
you do that!" announced Roy, and in a
moment the commander had his hand on
Herb's shoulder, though he was talking fast
to the other officers:</p>

<p>"Saw it all. Done standing. Quick work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
too; no dallying." Then to the lad: "Can
you repeat that?"</p>

<p>Herbert nodded. "That's not remarkable;
so can Flynn here. With practice 'most
anybody ought to."</p>

<p>"But they can't! Few can. Now, do you
think you could impart the knowledge; teach
something of the skill you have in shooting?
Because if you can we shall make you both
instructors. What do you think about it?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Match</span></p>


<p>Brigadier-general Harding,
grizzled, grim, but possessing that
human quality without which no commander
of men is entirely successful, gazed
into the level, steady, smiling brown eyes of
the boy who stood straight, tall and every
inch a soldier before him.</p>

<p>"Anyone who understands shooting at all
ought to be able to tell what he knows and
how he does it," Herbert answered. "Shooting
is a good deal like anything else that's
lots of fun; you've got to love it and study it
and have good eyes and then practise. And
then, too, there's the gun. You've got to
have a perfect gun to make A-1 scores and to
do any fancy shooting."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a good gun, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No; not very. I guess they make them
so fast and so many of them that the boring
tool wears and the rifling is not the best.
Then, too, the sights may not be perfectly
centered&mdash;you've got to look to that. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
stock, too, is queer; it doesn't fit like a gun
should."</p>

<p>"I have been led to suppose that this is as
good as a rifle could be."</p>

<p>"It may be as good as an army gun can be
made on contract, cheaply and in great quantities.
But I doubt even that. As a fine
shooting-piece it is not to be mentioned alongside
of the high-grade sporting rifles you can
buy. If you wanted to go into a rifle match,
or if you went after lions or elephants or
grizzly bears you wouldn't pick out this;
you'd get a gun with a reputation and that
you could rely on perfectly. With a gun of
that sort a nearly perfect score on a six-inch
bull's-eye wouldn't be out of the way."</p>

<p>"But these guns are all inspected, I am
told," argued the general.</p>

<p>"You can only inspect the shooting qualities
of a gun by trying it carefully; the bore
might look all right, but yet the grooves may
keyhole a bullet or cut one side out of it and
make it shoot almost around a corner."</p>

<p>"You keep your gun clean, of course? A
dirty gun may give bad results."</p>

<p>"Perfectly clean! A dirty gun will never
shoot straight."</p>

<p>The general turned to Roy Flynn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you can do this sort of hitting, too?
Let's see you."</p>

<p>And Roy did it, not exactly punching a
big hole in the center of his bull's-eye with a
few only a little nearer the edge, as Herbert
had done, but all his shots were safely in the
black. Again the letter "P" went up and
genuine admiration was expressed by the
little coterie of onlookers. Roy, answering
direct praise from Colonel Walling, indicated
his chum.</p>

<p>"Owe it to him, sir. He taught me to
shoot. Couldn't hit a flock of church steeples
comin' at me before he showed me. I used
to have a sort of bright idea that the harder
you pulled the trigger the harder she shot,
until he told me and which end to put to me
shoulder. But I agree with him about
these fowlin' pieces; they weren't rightly
made for shootin' at all, but I think for beatin'
carpet. You ought to just see me own gun
and Whitcomb's."</p>

<p>"What calibers are your guns?" asked the
general.</p>

<p>"They shoot a 30-30," Herbert said.</p>

<p>"Would you boys prefer using them?"</p>

<p>Both expressed themselves as most pleased
to be allowed to do this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then send for them; we shall have
them bored for the government cartridge, if
you are willing, and see if you can show them
superior. Will you see that this is done,
Captain Leighton? Now, Whitcomb, when
instructing, how would you go about it,
first?"</p>

<p>"Show a man how to hold a gun and how
to pull it hard against his shoulder. Then to
see his sights, hunting sights at first, with
both eyes open."</p>

<p>"Both open?"</p>

<p>"By all means, sir. That doesn't strain
the sighting eye; it doesn't dim the object
fired at; it permits, on the plan of the stereoscope,
to get some idea of the distance of the
target. I think that nearly all very expert
shots open both eyes; all trap shooters do."</p>

<p>The officers all laughed outright and the
general queried:</p>

<p>"How about that, Captain Pierce? You
are an expert shot, I believe."</p>

<p>"Not that expert!" The officer addressed
waved his hand at the targets. "Perhaps
the reason is that I shut one eye. But the
best marksman I ever knew, excepting present
company of course, an old fellow in the
West, used to open both eyes; he said no man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
could shoot excellently with one eye shut.
And yet, general, our physical examiners condemn
a bad right eye and admit a bad left
one."</p>

<p>"That's a question for them to settle at
Washington. Well, gentlemen, have these
scores all turned in for a general conference
on the subject and we shall pick our quota of
men for this new formation and recommend
officers. I shall name Whitcomb in ours,
for one squad, and as an instructor until they
leave. Come, there is much else to do."</p>

<p>"Fine, fine, fine business, old scout!"
caroled Roy when the two were alone. "I
knew you'd catch the boss."</p>

<p>"But, Roy, it isn't fair. I couldn't get in
a word&mdash;but you also deserve to be made a
corporal."</p>

<p>"Cor-nothing. A corpse, mebbe. And if
you don't have me in your squad, then, me
for a deserter, by cracky! Say, I wonder what
they are going to do with us as lead slingers,
anyway."</p>

<p>But this query was to remain unanswered
for many a long day, during which time the
business of the camp, that of making expert
soldiers, went on through the summer months,
the boys seeing many changes take place in
the make-up of the troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>After a time some were sent to the South;
others came: regiments of rookies, National
Guardsmen, regulars or some companies made
up of all of these, the purpose being for the
experienced men to set the greenhorns an
example.</p>

<p>But almost unchanged, though increasing
in numbers, the marksmen's platoon, at first
so called, but growing at last under instruction
into a full provisional company, went
bravely on perfecting itself in the art of
getting ready to knock over individual Germans
at long range, or to pot a low-flying
enemy airplane.</p>

<p>At this latter practice especially Herbert
became the admiration of the camp. Airplane-shaped
balloons were sent up on windy
days for the men to practise shooting at as
they were blown swiftly by, but the majority
were unsuccessful in hitting them, though a
degree of excellence on the part of many
rapid-firing marksmen was gained.</p>

<p>A lanky, loose-jointed, slow-moving young
fellow from the mountains of Kentucky, Jed
Shoemaker by name, long practised in the
truly fine art of barking squirrels and knocking
the heads off grouse, alternated with Herbert
in holding the record for puncturing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
bringing down these make-believe flying-machines;
and in several contests between
the two at ringed targets on short range the
Kentuckian led slightly in scoring, but at
long range, over a hundred yards, Herb generally
had a little the better of it.</p>

<p>At these matches the utmost good nature
was shown by both principals, though there
were several rooters for Herbert who tried to
belittle the mountaineer's shooting. But the
big fellow did not let this mar the kindliness
in his soul nor lessen his natural generosity
toward a competitor. He would not boast
over his winning.</p>

<p>Every time Herbert made a particularly
fine shot or won a match his opponent would
slap him on the back and shout:</p>

<p>"Center! Right in theh middle, b'gosh!
Good! That's theh dern time you-all seed
yer sights fine an' wiped my eye! Good boy!"</p>

<p>And Herbert was not to be outdone in this
matter. He recognized the Kentuckian's
real worth and a warm friendship sprang up
between them. Roy Flynn, ever jolly, bright
and big-hearted, and strong-minded Billy
Phillips, made up a quartet that always pulled
together and that never permitted to go
unchallenged any snobbish reference or slurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
at the mountaineer's backwoods' crudity.
An army camp is a mecca of democracy, and
any departure from the "Hail, fellow! Well
met!" scheme of things is almost unanimously
condemned.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, soldiers are but human, and
in spite of their grim work they want something
to laugh at, to make merry over, to
relieve the tension of long hours of hard and
almost constant effort. And such fellows as
Jed Shoemaker, in appearance, manners, talk,
could not help furnishing his companions
with the desired means for hilarity at the big
fellow's expense.</p>

<p>But the thing went further than this.
There are in every big bunch of boys some
who seem to get actual satisfaction out of
turning jest to earnest, of making hateful
reference out of happy chance; and such in
the camp also took their whack at poor Jed.</p>

<p>Among this fish-minded, low-diving fry
was Martin Gaul, he of the whisky-imbibing
tendencies. He did not seem to be able to
see the harmless, jovial, that's-a-good-joke-on-me
character of the Kentuckian and so he
turned what ludicrousness there was into
bitter ridicule.</p>

<p>Whitcomb, Phillips, and Williams had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
agreed to say nothing about Flynn's scrap
with Gaul, and Roy himself was the very last
man to tell of it. Therefore Gaul came to
recognize this and to gradually take advantage
of it, exerting again his bluster and bullying
tactics where he thought he could get away
with them. Gaul was never jovial or good-natured,
but in time became known in Company
H barracks as "the grouchy one."</p>

<p>Shoemaker, of Company D, now also an
instructor in rifle practise and a newly
appointed corporal in the marksmen's platoon,
was talking to several men outside of barracks
when Gaul joined them.</p>

<p>"We-all," announced the Kentuckian, "are
a-goin' tu have a leetle rifle match atween
two picked teams, an' hit's goin' tu be a
corker! Me an' Whitcomb's captins of theh
two bunches, an' jedgin' from theh way some
o' theh fellers is shootin' lately, it'll be a sight
tu make yer eyes watter."</p>

<p>"If your eyes watered much there wouldn't
be anything left of you, you big simp!"
snapped Gaul. "You don't think you can
get a bunch that can shoot with Whitcomb's
crew; do you? Won't have a show." Gaul
seemed unusually bitter.</p>

<p>"Mebbe not! Mebbe not! Cain't jest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
tell till they try. Theh's right smart fellers
tu pick from."</p>

<p>"Good land, fellow, where did you learn to
talk? You murder the language like a
butcher sticks hogs. Can't you speak English
better?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hain't had no chanct tu go tu
school none, er not much, anyway. Sort o'
reckon I kin make me understood, though,
some, even though I cain't spout like you-all,
b'gosh!"</p>

<p>"'You-all! Hain't! Reckon! Chanct!'
Saints have mercy! If I had to talk like that
I'd commit suicide. When you came here
from where you hang up your hat why didn't
you bring some brains, or don't they have
'em down there?"</p>

<p>"They has 'em, sure," laughed Jed, "but
mebbe they don't try to use 'em none, for
mighty few of 'em goes tu jail er Congress.
When this heh war is over how'd you-all like
tu come down theh in our mountings an'
learn we-uns some o' your blame smart
orneryness?"</p>

<p>This raised a laugh at Gaul and it very
naturally made that fellow lose his temper.
And with him to get angry was to want to
fight, or threaten it, getting away with the
bluff, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"What you want is a good, hard wallop,
you lop-sided ignoramus, and mebbe you'll
get it if you get too gay with me!" Had
Gaul turned then and seen Herb and Roy
standing observant across the company street
he would have been less blustering, but now
he had to talk loud to offset Shoemaker's wit.</p>

<p>But lanky Jed wasted no more repartee on
that evidently quarrelsome fellow, the sting
of whose sarcasm he had repeatedly felt
before. He only laughed, then grew suddenly
grave. He thrust his long face almost against
that of Gaul.</p>

<p>"I'm a-waitin' fer thet wallop!" he invited.</p>

<p>Gaul was more of a moral coward than a
physical one; he could never have it said
that he refused such a dare, especially from
an ignorant guy who surely could know
nothing of the manly art. And so Gaul made
the mistake of drawing back for a swinging
punch and in that second Jed's face was withdrawn
and with one swift leap upward, which
stunt previously no one would have given him
credit for, he shot out two long legs the extremities
of which caught Gaul in the chest and
sent him to earth in a heap. The others had
to lift him to his feet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Getting Over and On</span></p>


<p>This encounter, though witnessed by
only a half dozen, gave Jed Shoemaker
a new standing in the camp.</p>

<p>The shoot came off and it was a success in
that a fine degree of nearly equal interest in
the contesting teams was shown.</p>

<p>Shoemaker's team received about as much
applause as did the boys that Herb led; and
when the mountaineer's boys came out the
victors by the exceedingly small margin of
five in the total scores they got all that was
coming to them.</p>

<p>Then Jed was seen to go across to the
inspector-general, Colonel Short, and make a
request, whereupon the individual highest
scores were read out, Herbert leading in them.</p>

<p>In the cheering that followed it was plain
that the Kentuckian was the leader; and
when the two, Jed and Herb, advanced before
the officers' stand and warmly shook hands
there was another burst of applause, led by
Captain Leighton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>The general, joined by certain other officers,
came down from his seat and as the regimental
audience filed away he summoned both teams
to line up. He then addressed them:</p>

<p>"Men, this final test of marksmanship is
the crucial one in the selection of snipers&mdash;we
used to call them sharpshooters in the
old days&mdash;to form the first platoon, and others
will immediately follow. I know of no better
way than to pick by scores and general deportment,
for the first platoon, thirty-nine men
in all. Lieutenant Loring will lead you."</p>

<p>There was a very decided handclapping,
for Loring, though young, was deservedly
popular and had the distinction of having
served as a regular and corporal with Pershing
in Mexico and as a private in the Philippines.</p>

<p>"With the formation of the other platoons,
to form the first company of expert riflemen
from this camp and the first of the kind in the
army, I believe, your commander will be
Captain Leighton, now of our Company H."</p>

<p>The men all were pleased with this choice.
Herbert noticed that even Gaul, who had
scored fairly well in the shooting, vigorously
clapped his hands.</p>

<p>"The sergeants of this first platoon," continued
the general, "will be Berry and Small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and the corporals of the four squads are Whitcomb,
Phillips, Shoemaker and Lang."</p>

<p>Loud applause followed this combined
announcement of non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>The general further remarked upon the
necessity of continued drill and training
together in the new formation and added:</p>

<p>"Hold yourselves in readiness, men, for
orders that may come from Washington at
any time respecting new duties. Your squads,
Lieutenant Loring, may be divided up in
France, each serving on active duty with a
platoon reduced to three regular squads and
one of yours. It is the idea to place these
men in certain positions where organized
sniping is most effective, the snipers, of
course, to be protected by the regular men.
And now, I hope and feel sure that each and
every one of you, when before the enemy, will
give a good account of himself and do his duty
in our great cause!"</p>

<p>And the general received the greatest cheering
of the occasion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Old Ocean! The rolling, billowy blue,
apparently endless, with nothing but the
paler sky, sometimes the gray, threatening
sky, dipping into the dark water on every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
side. And the vessel; its never ceasing
engines throbbing, turning, whirring, sending
the great hull on and on and on, over swells,
through shorter billows, sloshing into whitecaps,
and the two insignificant humans up
there at the wheel directing the mapped
course of this great bulk of steel so that her
road was as clear, as certain, as though with
wheels under her instead of astern, she followed
a turnpike on the solid earth. But by
no means alone. Not far behind, so close
indeed that the white divided waters were
always visible, another transport, also full of
troops, sailed the blue sea, and back of that
still another plainly in sight in daytime and
at times discernible at night.</p>

<p>And on every side the greyhounds of the
sea. Uncle Sam takes chances in sending his
troopships over the ocean, for well he knows
that, lurking in many places, the enemy
submarines, the U-boats that have done most
to make the history of this war so remarkable,
and have added so greatly to its horrors, seek
their prey like man-eating sharks ready to
attack helpless swimmers.</p>

<p>The convoy vessels, with their sharp-eyed
watchers and heavy guns, bring to port in
safety the transport ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sorry for you, old chump," was Herbert's
remark to Roy, as the latter stood by the rail
in the wee small hours of night and made as
though to cast his entire stomach into the
briny depths far below. From bits of his
strained conversation one would imagine that
the boy might attempt to cast himself overboard
so as to keep company with the stomach
which so far he had been unable to detach,
and so Herbert chose not to leave him. "Say,
old man, what you want to do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you go plumb to thunder across lots
with what I ought to do!" groaned Flynn.
"You've told me about ten billion fool things
I ought to do. There's only one thing I
ought to do and that is die. If you felt like
me you'd say: 'Here goes nothin',' and hit
the briny kerplunk in about two seconds.
Take it from me, Herb, it isn't just awful;
it's worse than war. I'd rather go up to a
forty-two-centimeter just as she goes off and
feed me face with the shell comin' out of her
than be seasick. I'd rather swallow shrapnel,
time fuse and all, and have it go off and turn
me inside out than have this darned old
heavin' pond coax a ten-dollar dinner out o'
me. Say, I feel it comin' again!"</p>

<p>"Forget it," said Herb. "You come on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and lie down and that'll make you feel better.
Try it, at any rate. Come on now, or I'll
carry you down!"</p>

<p>Much of this sort of dialogue went on every
night, Roy finding, as did a few others, that
the doctor's medicine was not effective.</p>

<p>It was a relief to the boy, as well as to Herb
who had lost sleep remaining up with him
night after night, when the ship entered a
narrow harbor across a wide, unruffled bay
somewhere on the long coast of France and
warped up to a newly-timbered and planked
dock having all of the earmarks, as it were, of
American construction.</p>

<p>Indeed, a dozen carpenters who were unmistakably
Yankee in get-up and movements,
and who later proved it by their speech, were
still at work on the office building that flanked
the wharf. These fellows came in for a
guying.</p>

<p>The boys in khaki leaning over the side,
perched on cabin roofs, lifeboats, stanchions,
railings and in rigging, feeling more than gay
at seeing land again and the fact of having
had a safe trip against possible dangers, had
to let their exuberance be felt.</p>

<p>"Yip, yip, yip, yip! Get the dog-catcher's
net! There's a son-of-a-gun from the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of the sun; eh, Yank?" shouted Roy, leading
the fun, as usual.</p>

<p>"Sure, those ginks are all from God's
country!"</p>

<p>"Hey, Yank! Does your mother know
you're out, over here?"</p>

<p>"Hush, fellers! Salute; that there boob's
General Hatchet-and-Saw and yonder's Colonel
Sawdust!"</p>

<p>"Dollars to doughnuts they're makin' better
wages than John D&mdash;&mdash; right now!"</p>

<p>"Glory be! Wish I was a nail driver
'stead of a dough boy!"</p>

<p>"That good-lookin' fellow looks like he
came from good old Pittsburgh! That's my
city!"</p>

<p>"Huh! Don't see black soot on him!
Most clean people come from Detroit!"</p>

<p>"No; St. Louis. We wash out there more
than once a month, fellow!"</p>

<p>"In the Big Muddy, I reckon!" shouted
the Pittsburgher.</p>

<p>"And you need it twice a day!" was
shouted back.</p>

<p>"Hey, you wood butchers! Made any
coffins for the Booches yet? Soon's we get
there they'll need 'em!"</p>

<p>"Listen to him! Booches! Boshes, man;
that's the way to pronoun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hi, yi! Can the college education!
Everybody knows it's Bewches! Don't show
yer ignor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give him the Iron Cross! Boches, you
simp! Ask these natives over here; it's
their word."</p>

<p>"Bet you can't ask 'em anything; they'll
mostly beat it when you try to buy eats!"</p>

<p>"Say, Yank, hey! You with the square!
Had any frogs' legs yet? Or snails?"</p>

<p>"Oh, glory! Gimme some snails right now;
nice, fat ones, alive, fresh and salted! I
could eat thousand-leggers or rattlesnakes
right now!"</p>

<p>"Hooray! Wonder where we mess!"</p>

<p>"Next week! An' I feel like we messed last
in Noo York."</p>

<p>"Me! I'll be glad to get down on terra
cotta again!"</p>

<p>"Aw, terra firma, you blamed ignor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to the perfessor! Say, can't you
see a joke?"</p>

<p>"Say, fellers&mdash;everybody! Let's give a
big hooraw for the noble land of France.
Now, then, are you ready? Hip, hip&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The yell that followed might almost have
made the French think that the Boches had
made a land attack from the sea, did they
not know that now such was impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, even if the mess had not been
called for many hours after the landing, the
khaki-clad boys would not have gone hungry,
for as they fell in line on command and filed
down from the ship hundreds of kindly-faced
girls, lads, women and even old men, greeted
them smilingly and tendered each soldier a
dainty, ample bit of delicious food: meaty
sandwiches, tasty little cakes, cups of milk
and sour wine&mdash;looking surprised, indeed,
when the latter was refused by many, Herb
and Roy being among this number.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Loring, standing near and noticing
this, said to the boys:</p>

<p>"You are right, fellows, of course, morally
considering the matter, but here it is a little
different from our country. The water is
generally vile and often you will have to
endanger your health or go thirsty; besides,
there is so little alcohol in this common wine,
'<i>vin-ordinaire</i>,' they call it, that it is really
not intoxicating. That may let you down
occasionally for a drink of it when you can't
get milk."</p>

<p>Again, when thousands of long cigarettes
came their way, Herb and Roy were among a
very few who refused them. The donors
were taken aback, indeed. But the boys'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
messmates, those of their company, had long
since acknowledged the sanity of the arguments
against tobacco, even though failing
in the practise of abstinence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Facing the Enemy</span></p>


<p>"Go to it, old scout! That's what
we're here for."</p>

<p>Such was Corporal Whitcomb's
grave remark to Private Flynn when out of
the squad of eight expert marksmen stationed
in a rocky pit to help protect a certain new
havoc-wreaking, shrapnel-shooting field-piece,
three were chosen to first go out and stop
any attempt of the enemy to pot-shot the
artillerymen who were working the gun very
much to the hurt of the German trenches
three hundred yards away.</p>

<p>A little rocky hill held by the American
troops new in action gave a protection to the
position of the wonderful gun that shelled the
enemy trenches disastrously beyond and successfully
prevented the setting up of German
heavy ordnance in the vast plain in the rear.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, impossible to try to smash
the new gun by shells; it was well-nigh suicidal
to attempt to charge the position, and, therefore,
it became a matter of sharpshooting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of night raids and of dropping bombs from
German planes very high overhead.</p>

<p>But the enemy were soon to learn that in
the matter of marksmanship their best was
greatly outclassed, and also that to escape
injury from high-powered, .30-caliber bullets
sent into the air their warplanes had to seek a
very considerable elevation from which the
dropping of bombs was an uncertain thing.
Moreover, there were powerful French-American
airplanes not far behind the American
trenches, and they had come out and up to
meet these German planes, downing two of
them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from its pit, successfully bomb-proofed
and camouflaged, the new gun barked
every few minutes, throwing out no smoke
to disclose its position. From the hilltop
there was an occasional rattle of machine
guns and the crack of rifles, another squad
of snipers, under Corporal Lang, being there
on duty, backed also by a platoon of United
States Regulars. And on the other side of
the hill, Herbert learned, there was another
pit that contained another one of the terrible
new guns, similarly guarded by Billy Phillips'
squad and more Regulars.</p>

<p>That first twenty-four hours had been "a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
corker," as Roy Flynn put it. There had
been something doing every minute from the
time the platoon had left the French training
camp where Uncle Sam's infantry was getting
the fine points from French officers relative
to modern trench warfare.</p>

<p>At nightfall the platoon had entered six
auto trucks, called by the British "lorries,"
and had proceeded with a French guide toward
the front, though going where few knew, and
in fact the exact destination had been disclosed
only to lieutenant Loring and Sergeants
Barry and Small.</p>

<p>It had been very dark and rainy. The
road, at first smooth, had glistened like a
mirror; the occasional lights from road lamps
and windows, closer together in the villages,
had thrown a luster quite uncanny over
everything. Then the lights had become
less frequent, the road suddenly rougher,
even rutty, the speed had grown less and
they were always floundering along, or sometimes
stuck in the mud.</p>

<p>There had seemed to be little else in that
part of the world but mud, mud, mud! Yet
the boys had been compelled to get out of
the cars but little, even to ease the weight
when stalled, for the motors were powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and the trucks generally put up to give the
best of service.</p>

<p>Herbert and some of his squad had ridden
with Lieutenant Loring and the guide in the
first lorry and they had forged somewhat
in advance of the other cars, being stuck in
the mud but seldom, and had plowed through
puddles, holes and miry hollows with a certainty
that was admirable. Considering the
number in the car and Roy's presence and
the fact that the men had all slept well before
starting, there had been little said; often
they had covered miles without a word being
uttered.</p>

<p>Once two long, boxed-in autos, going very
slowly, had been met. The officer guide
had ordered a stop to exchange a few words
with the chauffeur of the cars, but dimly
seen by the occupants of the lorry. When
the guide had commanded the advance again
he had said something, in a low voice in
French, to the lieutenant. Loring had leaned
over toward Barry and Whitcomb and whispered
the one word: "Wounded."</p>

<p>On and on and on they had traveled.
Down into a valley, creeping across a narrow,
low bridge of stone; then slowly up and up
for a time; on the level once more, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
following the side of a ridge, as the horizon
on one side between a blank space of black
earth and the gray sky seemed higher than
the car. And then, from over to the left,
startlingly sudden to every one of those
hardy young Americans, had come the sound
of firing, the crack and crackle of firearms,
followed presently by the tearing, resonant
fusillading of a machine-gun that, at a distance,
reminds one of the rapid rolling of
a barrel down hill over stony ground.</p>

<p>Again the guide had made a remark which
Loring once more translated. "He says
that's what he likes to hear. Do you? Well,
I fancy we shall hear quite enough of it."</p>

<p>And then, half a mile farther on, during
which time all had distinctly discerned the
not very distant boom of cannon and once
again the nearer firing of many guns, the
French officer halted the car, waited until
the others had come up and then informed
Loring that from this on, for nearly a mile,
they must proceed silently on foot.</p>

<p>The command had been issued; a rough
formation had been made there in the rain
and the muddy road; the men had been
given extra loads of provisions to carry besides
their army kits, and they had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
forward, not a sound being uttered. After
a time rear sentries had received them, others
had been passed, one facetious Irishman
saying aloud to the lieutenant:</p>

<p>"This is worse than the East Side in a
raid in the gamblin' houses, bedad! An'
the weather ain't so bad in the dear ould
U. S., even in March, but nivver ye moind!
Jest go git thim Huns, me lad. Jest go git
'em! I wisht they'd be comin' my way now
an' thin."</p>

<p>Poor fellow! They learned afterward that
he had been transferred to the trenches later
and that the "Huns" had come his way.
No doubt many of the enemy had been sorry
for it and others had not gone back, but
neither had he. The first little American
burying ground at the bottom of the ridge
was as far as he and some of his fellows got.
The platoon to which they had belonged
still held the trench, though against odds.</p>

<p>At night, the darker the better, is the time
when there is an exchange of troops in the
trenches, when fresh contingents take the
places of those too long tried by the terrible
strain of standing guard against the enemy's
surprises, drives, raids, gas attacks, barrages,
bombing and shell fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>So the coming of the snipers' platoon had
been altogether favorable, not the hardiest
of the enemy daring to risk chances of going
against the little hill at a time when all the
advantage would be on the side of its defenders,
even though the Germans on this
sector outnumbered the Americans two to one.</p>

<p>The gun pits and their accompanying
dugouts, with pole and earth-covered shelters
begun by the French and greatly improved
by Uncle Sam's boys, were both crude and
comfortable, the drainage on the hillside
being far better than that of most trenches,
especially those in low ground. There was
mud, of course, though not so deep as if the
rain water had been allowed merely to seep
away. Then, too, the U. S. Regulars, under
cover of night, had cut numerous poles from
the young forest and on these had laid boards
sent over the route of frequent supplies.</p>

<p>Handing copies of maps to each of the
sergeants and corporals, Loring had detailed
the squads to the positions they now occupied.
With dispatches introducing him he went
with the first squad, Whitcomb's men, to
the first gun pit, sending the others on, with
their dispatches, where he was soon to join
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Into the north side gun pit, then, had
marched Herbert's squad; they were put
under the immediate command of Lieutenant
Jackson, U. S. A., middle-aged, firm and as
nearly silent as possible, and they at once
had been assigned to quarters, told to rest
and to eat. Loring had said a few words
to Herbert, shaken his hand and gone away.</p>

<p>After some hours Lieutenant Jackson came
to Herbert; the latter noticed that he had
not been sent for and that the officer seemed
to be, while enforcing discipline, a thoroughly
democratic fellow, aware of the conditions
of war, yet displaying that comradeship
which must spring up between men of sense
in times of danger and of stress.</p>

<p>"Your boys, I am told, are all fine shots.
Have they practised shooting at night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; much," Herb answered. "They
have been taught to see their sights against
the sky and quickly, without altering position
of eye and barrel, keeping the cheek against
the stock all the while, to put the muzzle
end on the object to be hit and press the
trigger. We hold both eyes open, as always,
when shooting, but especially at night, thus
seeing the object the more clearly. Nine
times out of ten we can hit a black mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
as big as a man a hundred yards, or over.
It depends, of course, upon how dark it is."</p>

<p>"See here, my boy, I'm going to leave the
placing of your men, the selection of them
for duty and the care of them, to you, the
general rules of our camp here to be followed.
You will fall into these quickly and you had
better keep your young men as much to
themselves as possible, fraternizing, of course,
when off duty. My men, being regulars,
are apt to regard you young chaps with small
respect for their soldierly qualities. I will,
however, issue orders for a contrary attitude;
I myself feel very different; young chaps
are the coming winners of this war, there's
no mistake."</p>

<p>"Now you can see what we're up against,"
he went on. "The Germans out there, or as
the French call them, the 'Boches,' can get
at us in no other way than by raids and
sniping. We have driven off two raids and
we have lost three men by sniping&mdash;three
good men, too. Now, it's up to you to see
to it that these snipers get sniped; to lay
for 'em and get 'em as they come. It'll be
hunting men who are hunting you, and the
best hunter and shot wins. Dangerous business,
my boy. Somehow I think that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
personally are equal to it, even though
you've never yet been under fire and you
may get nervous. But are your men equal
to it? It's not like a charge or phalanx
firing, nor company action. I've been there;
in the Philippines and at Santiago. Private
then. Your boys have all got to have their
nerve with them, as well as their skill. I
hope they have not made a mistake in sending
you here before you were tried under
fire. We shall see. But I suppose one place
to get used to it is as good as another.</p>

<p>"There is this about the situation also:
You not only have to beat the Hun snipers'
shooting, but you've got to see them first.
It's pretty certain you can't always do that.</p>

<p>"And here's another feature: You've got
to be good runners, for if you're hunting for
snipers, night or day, you may suddenly
run into a bunch of raiders. In some cases,
too, you may be placed so as to hold these
fellows off a bit until you can get word to us.
You see there are many situations possible
and there will be still more that you can't
think of; circumstances totally unforeseen
and sometimes mighty hard to comprehend
in a hurry. Just the other day we had one.</p>

<p>"The gun boys were giving her a cleaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
up&mdash;they keep her pretty nice, you see, just
like a fire company does its engine; take a
real pride in it. Well, they were working
away, or five of them were&mdash;four were sleeping.
My men were mostly loafing and sleeping,
too, and some were on guard and lookout,
one fellow at the listening point. I was
making out reports and accounts&mdash;there's
too much of that. There wasn't a gun to
be heard for miles; all quiet, except for the
big guns over on the French sector, ten miles
away, that you heard a while ago.</p>

<p>"Then, all of a sudden the men at post
called out: 'Airplane high up! French
machine coming back from the Boche line!
They're shooting at her!'</p>

<p>"We heard several guns go off over in their
trenches, but as she kept on we didn't think
any more about her. It's a common enough
sight and I had gone back to my papers
and the boys to their duties.</p>

<p>"And then, it didn't seem to me to be
five minutes before the awfullest kick-up of
dust and rocks I ever saw, or hope to see,
upset the whole bunch of us&mdash;it was right
on the outside of the pit, though we've got
it pretty well smoothed over now. It blinded
one of my men permanently, poor chap;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
sent him back yesterday. And it laid another
up for a bit; struck in the back with a big
flying stone. Blew all my papers so far
I've never been able to find half of them.
You see this is war!</p>

<p>"That was no French plane; it was a Hun.
He had painted his blamed machine so it
looked like a Frenchman; mebbe it was a
captured one in the first place, and then,
when he got well over our lines, he turned
and shut off his engine and dived right down
over our pit. Did it so quick nobody got
on to him to shoot at him until he had dropped
his bomb and if that had hit our shelter top
it would have got every one of us and upset
the gun.</p>

<p>"But they got him beyond just as he was
going over their trenches; our gun men had
luckily just slipped a shell in and the corporal
jumped and sighted and let Mr. Birdman
have it just once, and, by jingo, it got him!
Busted twenty feet to one side of him, turned
him clear over and dumped him on the
ground; smashed the machine all up, of course.
What it did to the man you can guess.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is war, my boy! Real war!
As I said, I haven't been able to find half
of those reports yet."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">War is&mdash;War!</span></p>


<p>Yes, it was war. There could be no
question about its being the real
thing, with all the frills and thrills
that go along with a gigantic, brain-taxing,
muscle-straining attempt to kill an enemy
and not be killed by him.</p>

<p>If Sherman designated the kind of war
practised two generations ago as having a
resemblance to the infernal regions, what
would he call war as practised in this generation?
A combination it is of dozens of varied
Hades, with all the little devils of hate and
villainy and slow torture thrown in.</p>

<p>Corporal Herbert Whitcomb, though a
mere boy, had been placed in the command
he held, however small, because of his wonderful
skill in shooting, together with his manliness,
strength of character and the reputation
he had earned for doing everything well
that he was set to do at the training camp
back in the dear old United States.</p>

<p>With his introduction to the combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
trench and gun pit on the French front and
the duties he was compelled to assume as
commander of a squad of snipers, he was at
once impressed with the fact that this was
war; and in a very short time thereafter
that war is hell.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jackson, of the old Regular
Army and a veteran of long service, who
was in command of the pit and was Herbert's
superior officer, had told him enough to
render such a verdict and to impress him with
the seriousness of the job before the Allies,
the American Army and their small body of
men, fifty-seven in all, in the pit. These
comprised the platoon of Regulars, thirty-two
men, four corporals, two sergeants and the
lieutenant, the artillery squad of eight men
and one corporal, and the sniper squad of an
equal number.</p>

<p>The Regular Army men were generally
rough-and-ready fellows, admirably fitted for
any duty of war, except that only two or
three of them were admittedly expert shots.
These had tried sniping, but were too few in
numbers to awe the German long-distance
sharpshooters making attempts to kill off the
artillerymen.</p>

<p>The men who handled the gun were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
mixed lot. Three had been in the Marines,
two were Regular Army artillerymen, one was
a recently enlisted man who possessed a
special talent for hitting the mark with a
cannon, another was a fighting cook for this
outfit; and the corporal, James Letty, had
been a football star.</p>

<p>Anyone could look over the platoon and
see that they were a hard crowd to beat.
Therefore, when Whitcomb sent Flynn and
Marshall out on the first scouting and sniping
duty, thus honoring them, and to Flynn
said, "Go to it, old scout!" he felt most
truly the importance of the statement that
they were there for the purpose of warfare.</p>

<p>By "Go to it!" Herb meant that their
first business was to let no German get into
a position where he might drop bullets into
the gun pit where the squad was operating
so successfully as to actually threaten the
maintenance of the German position at that
point.</p>

<p>With Roy went Dave McGuire, one-time
glove salesman in a city department store.
He had shot one of the highest, very long
range rifle scores at Camp Wheeler, and he
possessed certain characteristics that did not
seem to be at all in keeping with his former
calling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Herbert could not help wondering at the
fellow's bravery. He possessed a manner
that by some would have been termed "sissy;"
he drawled his words and lisped a little, opened
his mouth to speak with drawn lips, seemed
to have the idea that army life should be on
the order of a social gathering; and his khaki
clothes, by long habit, were put on and worn
with scrupulous neatness.</p>

<p>Could he stand the strain of being shot at,
of living long in a muddy hole in the ground,
under the constant expectation of something
or other happening that might cost him and
his companions their lives?</p>

<p>Not far down the hill several piles of heavy
stones offered the American riflemen excellent
shelter for observation and marksmanship.
There were some shell holes also and at one
spot a partly wrecked bomb canister of heavy
sheet iron within which a man might crouch
unseen by the enemy beyond.</p>

<p>All of these places offered a fair view of the
zigzag German trenches for a distance of
more than five hundred yards where the
trench dipped behind a wooded rise of ground.
Beyond this the enemy had their hands full
opposing the extension of the American
trench which wound about from near the
gun pit to and also beyond the wooded slope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Herbert saw his two boys go out on the
hill with a feeling of nothing else than sorrow.
To be sure this was the game of war, but he
could not help feeling a marked aversion
for the possibilities uppermost in this death-grapple
business.</p>

<p>For his men particularly and for all his
fellows in battle, companions in discomfort,
danger, suffering, perhaps death, was the
lad concerned. Especially did he feel this
now regarding Roy. His chum, ever bright,
smiling, jesting, never grumbling nor down-hearted,
was going out there to be the target
for men trained in this wholesale killing
business and eager to play their part. It
was true that the boy could hardly be caught
napping and he would probably give a little
better than he was sent, but still there were
the chances of warfare, often more potent,
more death-dealing than the best laid plans.</p>

<p>Herb had never since babyhood known
anything of a mother's teachings that to the
many well-balanced, gentle-dispositioned lads
often mean so much for good. His father
had well cared for him when he was a little
fellow and then he, too, had died without
ever having rightly influenced the boy at a
time when this would have counted best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
And though Herbert's inclinations had all
been healthy, clean, vigorously manly and
honest, it is doubtful if he had said or thought
a prayer a half dozen times in his life, or that
he really knew how to pray in the commonly
practised manner of those who habitually
turn to a Higher Power.</p>

<p>But now, watching Roy and Dave ascend
the stepped slope out of the pit and by
Herb's order begin to slip off cautiously,
screening themselves behind various obstacles
and making for the objects of shelter below,
the young corporal was suddenly overcome
with a dejection very unseemly for an officer
engaged in fighting. Unseen, the boy bowed
his head against one of the timber stanchions
of the shelter.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, if you're willing, if it isn't
laid down in the Book of Fate otherwise,
don't let that chum of mine get killed! He's
too fine a chap; he brings too much happiness
to others in this world and does too much
good generally for him to become the victim
of a bullet or bayonet, or anything like that!
And the other fellow, too; he seems like a
good sort of fellow. Most of my men are;
all in this pit are worth being kept alive.
I'm sure of it! But, of course, some of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
must get it; be killed or wounded some way.
So don't think I mind being one, if that would
spare the percentage and spare these other
fellows who have homes and people to mourn
for them. Anyway, God, above all, no matter
what may be going to happen, see to it that
we all do our duty and give us what ought
to be coming to us if we don't."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Double Surprise</span></p>


<p>Roy and Dave had come back unharmed
from the first sniping expedition
of the squad against the enemy's
snipers. The former was elated at having
seen a German who had crawled out of the
enemy trench some distance into "No Man's
Land," as the space between the opposing
trenches has been nicknamed, stick his head
and gun above a fallen tree trunk, shoot at
Roy, and upon Roy's returning the compliment
go down quickly, not to reappear.
The German's bullet had chipped a bit of
stone off not five inches from Roy's nose.</p>

<p>"Think sure I got the sucker and I hope
he was Kaiser Bill himself! I kept watchin'
for him, Herb, for about half an hour and
he never showed up. Now, who'll get out
there to bury him, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Let us hope somebody does tonight,"
Herb said.</p>

<p>"Hope that? Cracky, me lad, not so fast!
If they got that far they'd forget the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
one and try to make one of us live ones a
dead one. But, say, if some of us can sneak
down there and lay for them when they do
come out for him, we could take 'em prisoners
easy. How 'bout it?"</p>

<p>"Don't seem like fair and square fighting,"
said Herb.</p>

<p>"But <i>they</i> do these things!" Roy argued.</p>

<p>"Two wrongs don't make a right."</p>

<p>"They will make a capture, though, sure
as you're a foot high! Try it and let me in
on it."</p>

<p>"But it will be your time sleeping. Well,
maybe we can plan it. I'll talk with the
lieutenant."</p>

<p>That night it came on to rain, harder than
it had yet come down since the squad had
been in France. Everything was soggy and
soaked; the atmosphere seemed like a big
sponge surcharged with endless dampness.
Slickers were in demand and all guns and
revolvers for those going forth were well
cleaned and oiled.</p>

<p>Out of the pit and through the intense
darkness Corporal Whitcomb led a party of
six others, one-half of his own men and two
Regulars of the platoon, all prepared for
dealing a surprise. But, along with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
enemy, they, too, experienced the unexpected,
which in this case might better be called
simply a streak of luck.</p>

<p>Long before dark, though compelled to
dangerously expose himself, Herbert had
drawn up a rough but effective map of the
slope between the pit and the German
trenches, actually going over some of the
ground afoot and being shot at several times
from the trench, but from a safer place
covering the rest with his glass. Especially
prominent on the map was made the fallen
trunk where lay the German victim of Roy's
superior marksmanship. And when Roy
showed this map and his plan of action to
Lieutenant Jackson the latter said:</p>

<p>"That's the stuff! It ought to earn you a
commission. Hope you can carry it out.
Yes, take Murphy and Donaldson, if you
want. We'll lay low up here ready for a
counter-raid if you signal us."</p>

<p>Now, down the slope the men followed,
single file, until they had covered nearly half
the distance; then Herb felt a touch on the
arm. Dave McGuire saluted and whispered:</p>

<p>"Have a notion that&mdash;ah&mdash;these fellows
are expecting we shall undertake something
like this and&mdash;all&mdash;are going to lay for us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Maybe we might divide up, go two ways&mdash;ah&mdash;and
get the drop&mdash;ah&mdash;on them, as they-ah&mdash;say,
corporal."</p>

<p>"I have already planned for that; but
thanks, old man. We'll do that very thing."</p>

<p>One group of four went a little to the right
of the fallen tree and sought places of hiding;
the other two, with Herbert, went to the left
and found an old shell pit into which they
all crawled. The instructions from the lieutenant
had been for all to pull some grass
and leaves to partly camouflage themselves.</p>

<p>The wisdom of this was shown not half
an hour later when a low-flying airplane
suddenly rose, sailed over the spot and threw
a rather uncertain searchlight upon the slope,
surely not detecting one of the hidden
Americans.</p>

<p>The gun in the pit did not fire a shot at
the flying-machine. The enemy might have
been suspicious of that, though they must
have believed that the birdman offered too
uncertain a mark on which to waste shells
in the dark, and then the flier's report gave
them an assurance of safety.</p>

<p>The boys lay waiting long and not too
patiently&mdash;for who can easily endure such
conditions? There was no let-up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
cold rain, which after a time became half
sleet. Lying on the cold, soggy ground,
chilled and uncomfortable, the boys after a
time grew restive. Roy, with the four on
one side, cautioned silence. Herbert wondered
how the fastidious McGuire was putting up
with all this. Then, suddenly:</p>

<p>"Hist!" from one side. "Hist!" came
from the other and at once the silence was
more impressive than death itself. For,
perhaps, as they all thought, death might
soon follow.</p>

<p>Up the slope beyond and slowly approaching
came the sound of many heavily-shod
feet, and dark figures began to loom in the
blackness, coming straight for the tree.</p>

<p>The American youngsters lay ready as
pumas to spring amongst fat deer; they
hardly breathed, the tense situation holding
every man to the duty expected of him
and in which he now gloried, eager to act.</p>

<p>More and more gray figures came dimly
into view until, around the fallen tree, nearly
a score of men stood silently, only one of them
occasionally uttering an exclamation, or a
word or two. Herb knew that Ben Gardner,
once a buyer of toys in Europe, spoke German
fluently and he had kept Ben beside him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
for a purpose. Asking him afterward what
remarks the leader of the Germans had made,
Gardner explained:</p>

<p>"Well, first he asked: 'Where is he?'
and then: 'How can I believe it?' and once
he said: 'Where could the American have
been to kill him with the first shot?' When
they explained this to him he only grunted
about ten times. It must have been a
stumper."</p>

<p>But in Corporal Whitcomb's mind was a
more engrossing question than any normal
actions of the Germans could have further
created. Greatly outnumbered, was he to
give the signal to act on the offensive, or to
let the chance go by and run no risks?</p>

<p>Had he known then that a German division
commander, a general of note, had been
examining the trench at length and hearing
of the death of Godfrey Schmaltz, once big
game hunter and one of the best shots in all
the Fatherland, had risked the chance to
come now and inspect the place and manner
of the great marksman's defeat, the young
corporal would have hesitated not at all
and have risked everything. But now he
seemed disposed to wait too long. Gardner,
however, must have guessed the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
more clearly. He nudged Herbert and whispered:</p>

<p>"Big gun, I believe! Better get him!
Now's our chance!"</p>

<p>And Herb, his mind suddenly set to the
task, gave the signal&mdash;the flash of an electric
handlight into the mist.</p>

<p>The seven were all on their feet in an
instant and advancing upon the enemy.
At the same moment Gardner shouted in
the German tongue:</p>

<p>"Hands up, or death to all instantly!
You are our prisoners!"</p>

<p>Herbert called to Roy and Martin Gaul,
who were nearest, to quickly disarm the
Huns; and the way the few guns were
snatched from the men and tossed aside
must have much surprised them. One big
fellow struck at Roy, and the man got a blow
in the face which staggered him.</p>

<p>There was an attempt at a scurry among
the German officers when the ambush was
sprung and the order given them. It was a
palpable effort to shield or to effect the
escape of one of their number, the general.</p>

<p>Dave McGuire saw this, having come
around on that side in the movement to
surround the huddled enemy, and he acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
with the speed of a hawk. Shoving his
pistol into the face of the nearest Boche,
the young fellow began lisping some words
in English which were probably poorly understood,
if at all, but he did not get very far
with his speech.</p>

<p>Dave's arm was knocked aside and a Hun
officer leveled a pistol at him, fully getting
the drop on him. By all rules of the game,
this was a signal for surrender on Dave's
part, but Dave wasn't abiding by any rules
just then. The Hun officer suddenly felt
in the pit of his stomach a boot that had the
force of a Missouri mule back of it and when
he rose from the mire he found himself a
prisoner.</p>

<p>Dave made the others believe, seeing their
companion fall and the American's pistol
again threatening them, that there was nothing
left them but to accept the situation;
and though the general, much to his credit
for pluck, made another attempt to get away,
he also got Dave's foot with equal force,
but on the shin, and he couldn't have run
then to save his life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all of the other six had performed
quite admirably and impressed upon
the German officers and men the fact that
they were at the mercy of the Americans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell them to keep mighty quiet, Gardner,"
Herbert ordered, and this also was conveyed
to them in words the prisoners clearly understood.
"And to head up the hill and step
lively," the corporal added.</p>

<p>They headed up and stepped. Two lagged
a little, but one of the Regulars, Murphy,
prodded those grumbling Huns with his
brawny fist and they fell in with the others.
As though by previous drill, the captors
arranged themselves about the prisoners with
instant comprehension of the entire situation.
Ready to pour in a murderous fire with the
first movement in an attempt to escape, and
believing that such an attempt might be made
at any moment, two of the squad marched
to the right and two to the left of the captured
Germans, while Herbert and Donaldson followed
in the rear and Gardner led the way,
walking backward up the slope, now and then
urging the captives to step along quickly.</p>

<p>They had covered two-thirds of the distance
to the gun pit when one of the general's aides
or staff suddenly gave a low order, and turned
and rushed boldly upon the nearest American.
Half the number of Germans, with something
like a roar, followed his example in what,
against a less determined resistance must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
have been a successful break-away for most
of them.</p>

<p>But half a dozen revolvers barked and
just as many Teutons went to the ground,
two never to rise again by their own efforts,
for the distance was short and the American
boys were ready. The Huns fell back again
into a bunch, the general unwounded.</p>

<p>And then out came the raiders. The
firing proved a signal and they knew that
their commander was in danger. From the
German trench the soldiers climbed; and
though they could not be seen, the rapid
commands, the rattle of fixing bayonets,
the tramp of hasty feet were very audible.
Herbert listened for a second and then
shouted:</p>

<p>"Never mind picking up those fellows,
but get the rest up to the pit! Rush 'em
now; rush 'em! Flynn," he called, "go
for the pit like the Old Scratch was after you,
and tell Lieutenant Jackson the enemy's out
and coming!"</p>

<p>Just then the entire bunch of captors and
captives found themselves in what was equal
to the glare of day; a searchlight from the
German trench had found them.</p>

<p>The sharp roar of the American gun in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
pit jarred the earth, and instantly the darkness
was over everything again. The Yankee
artillery-men had found the searchlight and
with the first shot.</p>

<p>But that moment of white light had shown
some morose, ugly, hate-bearing faces and
booted figures huddled in a group, and on
the ground some lying prone, others in a
sitting posture, while about them stood a
number of grim fellows, with pistols in hand.
And the light had shown on the hill Roy
Flynn going up the grade at a speed that
would have done credit to most sprinters
on the level. Roy had been the hundred-yards
man at Brighton for three terms.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jackson had his Regulars down
the hill into the center of No Man's Land
almost before the Germans had all climbed
out of their trenches, and when the latter
came on in the darkness they were received
with such a withering fire that the survivors
broke and fled back in a hurry.</p>

<p>"By jingo, corporal, you certainly have
done yourself and all of us proud!" was
Lieutenant Jackson's remark to Herbert a
half hour later when the prisoners had been
questioned, disposed of and a guard set over
them, and in their warm dugout shelter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
squad of snipers were gathered about the
trench stove.</p>

<p>"All you fellows," he went on, "ought to
be promoted for this night's work; that's a
fact. I don't want to take a bit of the glory
away from you; I want you to make out and
send in with mine a complete report of your
work in capturing these&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll be perfectly content to have you do
it all, Lieutenant," Herbert replied.</p>

<p>"But I won't. You can write better than
I can. When they hear you've snared this
big chump, General What's-his-name, they'll
tumble over themselves to get you a commission.
You deserve it. We're all finding
out what the Johnny Bulls tell us: the non-coms
and the subs have about as much to do
with this scrap as the generals and colonels."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hunting Big Game in No Man's Land</span></p>


<p>There was nothing of self-consciousness
about Corporal Whitcomb over
the capture of a high commander
of the enemy on almost the first night of his
experiences at the front. As Roy Flynn put it:</p>

<p>"Herb's never chesty; wasn't at school,
though heaps o' duffers who couldn't stay
with him in anything, indoors or out, would
swell up like poisoned pups. That's Herb."</p>

<p>Just then the object of the conversation
walked into the dugout.</p>

<p>"When are they going to send his nibs,
General Sauerkraut, to the rear, Corporal?"
asked Sniper G. Washington Smith.</p>

<p>"As soon as the patrol arrives; to-morrow
at the latest. I believe he talked some to
Gardner last night; tried to bribe him.
Flynn, your turn on guard duty, now, over
the prisoners. Relieve Watson. The lieutenant
wants one of our men with three of
his over them all the time. Gaul, you go on
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have most of you fellows washed, shaved,
and eaten breakfast?" continued Herbert.
"If so, we'd better all go out on the hill
again for a little while and try to head off
those snipers from the other side. Letty
says they are getting busy after the big gun.
Two bullets flattened on his sight guard a
little while ago; one of them must be closer
than they've been yet."</p>

<p>"Ain't <i>you</i> the feller to get him?" queried
Martin Gaul.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Gaul? Anything
getting on your nerves?"</p>

<p>"No more'n on yours or anybody's. Show
me the man who's in love with all this. That
old gun up there would drive a stuffed dummy
crazy, and bullets droppin' in here every now
and then and expecting them Boches to drop
in, too; and dirt and filth and crawlers and
cookin' your own meals, and cold nights&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think that's showing the right
spirit? All of us are putting up with the
same discomforts, the same nerve strain and
we're getting sport out of it, or at least the
consciousness that we must sacrifice comforts
for the cause. You are the first I have
heard complain. Best to chime in, old man,
and cut out the kicks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mebbe you'd kick, too, if you were sick,"
Gaul said.</p>

<p>"Sick? Well, now, that's different. What's
the matter? Just how do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Sore all over. Cold, I reckon. Head
aches. Pain in my face, too. Got no appetite."</p>

<p>"Sudden, then; eh? Saw you eating a
while ago as if you never expected to get any
more. You know the grub lorries get here
once in so often and enough. But turn in on
your cot now and cover up warm. Geddes,
you heat Gaul a cup of tea and take and dry
his shoes. And put on dry socks, Gaul.
I'll get you some pills. Get ready, fellows!
Geddes, you join us when you can. Are
all your guns clean? Remember, you want
your gas masks along. There's no telling
when the Boches may let go some of that
stuff."</p>

<p>Sneaking, crawling, seeking every bit of
cover, getting into pits made by formerly
exploded shells when the Germans had driven
the French for a time a year before from this
same spot, the five snipers worked over the
slope and sought by every means to locate
and fire upon those of the enemy who were
at the same job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Herb lay behind a pile of débris once tossed
up by a shell, his gun over a mass of pebbles
in which he had, with a stick, pushed two
narrow grooves, one for his weapon, the
other as a peep-hole. To get him, a bullet
would have to hit exactly in this groove,
in line with it; otherwise the stones would
deflect it upward.</p>

<p>The lad studied the entire landscape all
the way to and beyond the German trenches,
a third of a mile away. If, in the equal
number of hiding places below, there was a
decided motion of any kind he should have
been able to see it.</p>

<p>He heard no shots from his men now
scattered over the slope; evidently the Hun
marksmen were not out, or were keeping very
still. He lay silent, alone, under the warming,
welcome sun of late autumn.</p>

<p>It had been a beautiful day, following
almost a week of incessant rain. The sun
shone in a sky almost without clouds. All
along the trenches for a long distance there
was not a sound of firing, not an impression
on the ear that even slightly suggested two
opposing armies seeking to shed each other's
blood.</p>

<p>Far over beyond the hillside a bird, welcoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the sunshine also, caroled a lively
ditty over and over again. Herbert guessed
it was some kind of a linnet and wished that
he might calmly arise without a sense of
danger and go to spy on the singer. A
plucky, little feathered adventurer it must be,
indeed, to boldly invade this area of killing
and to give such small heed to the deafening
boom of great cannon and the frequent
crackle of rifles and machine guns.</p>

<p>McGuire it was who crept on hands and
knees or advanced in a stooping posture,
according to the depth of the sheltering
stones or bushes between himself and the
enemy, and when within speaking distance
of Herbert, began a desultory conversation.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;know they are on the&mdash;ah&mdash;hill,"
he announced, meaning, of course, the Germans.
"Saw one, if not&mdash;ah&mdash;two, or more.
They are lying just as low&mdash;ah&mdash;as we are
and are&mdash;ah&mdash;taking no chances, I presume.
Is it not a most beautiful day?"</p>

<p>"A ripper, sure!" was Herbert's reply.
"You ought to keep mighty well down,
McGuire. 'Tisn't safe to show yourself too
much."</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;ah&mdash;know," said the ex-glove
salesman, "I do not believe those fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
can shoot well enough to&mdash;ah&mdash;hit me this
far away. It is very fine shooting to do so."</p>

<p>"They are not all poor shots, by any
means," asserted Herbert.</p>

<p>"I think I&mdash;ah&mdash;would take chances with
the best of them and how greatly I&mdash;ah&mdash;hope
for the opportunity." The young
man smiled in the very sweet but sad sort
of way that must have helped him sell many
a pair of gloves. He turned about and
crept to a pile of stones and began another
survey of the hunting field.</p>

<p>Herbert wondered where the German
marksman could have been located that
had harassed the gun crew earlier in the
morning and that he had come out to locate
and drive off. There were plenty of hiding
places, to be sure, but the fellow must disclose
his position now if he began shooting
again. And it was the business of the sniping
squad to stop this.</p>

<p>To the right three of Herb's men had
located themselves, this offering the likeliest
situation for protection to the gun. It was
too far away from the German trench to
be in danger from rifle fire, but here enemy
snipers could venture out.</p>

<p>Over to the left the ground was clearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of long grass, low bushes and rocks and
still beyond that, in No Man's Land, perfectly
bare.</p>

<p>The young corporal had about given up
the idea of snipers immediately opposing
his position. He was thinking of returning
to the pit to perform certain duties falling
constantly upon a leader of even a few men,
for he must do all in his power for their
comfort and well being, when he heard a
low exclamation come from McGuire. Herbert
even recognized the halting "ah" somewhere
in it, though he did not fully catch
the words. But he saw the man quickly
level his gun over the stone pile and fire.</p>

<p>There was no answering shot, and for
some little time McGuire lay there inert.
Herb could not fully see the precise object
of the ex-salesman's marksmanship; he was
aware only of a shell pit and its tossed-up
earth pile, and a gun muzzle sticking above
it. This gradually was lowered.</p>

<p>"Lay low, McGuire!" Herbert cautioned,
seeing the fellow beginning to rise up and
peer over his stone pile in an effort to see
what effect his last shot had taken. And
then he was aware that McGuire was not
looking in the direction of the shell pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Far beyond and to one side of the shell
pit, easily a distance of three hundred yards,
a German sniper was crawling flat on his
stomach in an effort to gain a better shelter;
perhaps he believed himself unseen. He
was almost hidden from Herbert.</p>

<p>McGuire's gun spoke again; the fellow
had risen on one knee to shoot with a clearer
view. The crawling German rolled over,
appeared as though he were trying to tie
himself into a knot and then suddenly collapsed
and lay still.</p>

<p>Twice again and in rapid succession
McGuire fired; Herbert saw all this, but
not clearly, though he was about to shoot
also on a chance. The other had the nearer
and better view and he was now on his feet.</p>

<p>One of the enemy, on his knees and still
farther below, had leveled his gun, but before
he could pull the trigger he had pitched
forward, where he lay still; another, too, had
bravely risen to his feet and was taking an
aim at McGuire when he also went down.</p>

<p>And then there was a crack from the rifle
in the near shell pit.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye Herbert saw
McGuire fall to the ground; he knew by
that momentary instinct that is never failing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
what this meant. But he did not then turn
his head. Instead his eyes were leveled
along his pet gun barrel and beyond to where
merely the helmet, the forehead and the eyes
of a man showed above the shell-pit mound.</p>

<p>Herb had to make quick, sure work of it.
But with the crack of his rifle, knowing just
where that bullet would go, the boy could
not resist a sickening, pitying sensation, for
proof of his accurate aim came when the
German half rose out of the shell pit and
lay prone across his fallen gun.</p>

<p>The corporal, himself now almost unmindful
of danger, stooping, crossed to where
McGuire lay, and knelt beside him. A
glance told him enough. With something
like a sob Herbert began to work his way
back to the gun pit.</p>

<p>"Dead instantly," was his remark to Lieutenant
Jackson. "But he died a hero's
death. Outshot the German snipers, as he
said he could, and got three of them before
a fourth got him. Poor chap, he was as
brave as ten tigers and as gentle as a lamb.
Our first man to go."</p>

<p>"There will likely be others, Whitcomb.
You must get used to it. The fortunes of
war, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>But a fellow of Herbert's make-up never
could, nor did he ever, get used to such a
thing. Though not the less determined to
do his duty, he was now more than ever
down on and disgusted with the whole useless,
hateful, miserable business of war.</p>

<p>Down the slope toward the German
trenches lay four dead Germans, perhaps
some of them not quite dead; possibly still
suffering, bleeding, dying slowly, and where
they could not be reached because of the
unremitting desire of both sides to take every
advantage of an enemy. There was no such
thing as the white flag for purposes of succoring
the wounded in No Man's Land.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Traitor in Camp</span></p>


<p>Corporal Whitcomb could not
sleep. There was no particular reason
for this, except mental worry and a
too vivid imagination. Was the life in
trench and gun pit getting on his nerve?
Was he, a mere boy, too much over-wrought
with his responsibility? Not so; the sort of
happy disposition that he possessed never
balks at nerve strain nor breaks with the
effort of duty, no matter how urgent, or disappointing
the result.</p>

<p>Despite the trials upon his sense of justice
and naturally gentle regard for humanity
he knew only duty and strove with an intense
effort to perform every task entrusted to him.</p>

<p>The squad had been but five days in the
gun pit so far, and it seemed like twice that
many weeks. There had been the almost
incessant hammering of the big gun on the
trenches and distant works of the enemy
and at the airplanes venturing overhead,
four of which it had brought down in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
time, added to three others since the long-barreled
wonder had been set in place. It
had been a surprise to the enemy and a
masterly bit of work to place these several
weapons in such close proximity to the enemy's
lines and the duty had fallen upon well-picked
troops and expert riflemen to guard
these guns.</p>

<p>There had been the constant sniping,
night and day, by successive numbers of
the sharpshooters' squad. There had been
fifty-seven men in the pit when Herbert
came, his own included; now there were
but fifty. Three lay in the graveyard beyond
the hill; two were sick; two, badly wounded,
had been taken by the last patrol to the
base hospital at LaFleche. Besides these,
nine altogether, mostly of the gun crew,
had so-called trench feet, from standing long
in cold water and mud and not caring immediately
for the first consequences of frost
bite.</p>

<p>But it was a very different matter from the
impressive call to duty that bothered Herb
Whitcomb. It was simply that he could
not help feeling doubtful of one of his men.</p>

<p>When Martin Gaul had qualified for the
snipers, with a very fair score at the rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
ranges, Herbert had frankly requested that
he be assigned to another squad, but the
officers making the drawings had refused this.</p>

<p>Before Gaul had been three days in the
pit he had begun to grumble; once he had
shown the white feather by remaining behind
a nearly perfect shelter, instead of venturing
out to hunt for enemy marksmen. And
yesterday he had developed his old-time
grouch and ready excuses.</p>

<p>Returning to the dugout, Herbert had
found Gaul much better and even inclined
to be facetious. Learning of McGuire's
death, he had expressed no sorrow, as the
others had done, or would do when they got in.</p>

<p>There had been all along a warm fraternal
spirit shown among the members of the
rifle squad, each one showing a generous
sympathy for and an interest in his comrades,
but Gaul had been the exception; by his
own choice he had withdrawn from the
human touch and brotherly affections naturally
springing up between men living the
same strenuous existence.</p>

<p>Was it a sense of impending danger that
troubled Herbert this early night? Some
materialistic philosophers tell us that there
are no such things as premonitions, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
others, perhaps wiser, insist that, logically,
we possess a sort of sixth sense that is not
always easy to analyze. Therefore, we may
receive an impression and only half guess
its meaning or hardly know that we have
received it.</p>

<p>Herbert rose from his straw bed, pulled
on his shoes and walked softly into the
adjoining earthen chamber separated from
that of the snipers' squad by a vertically
cut mass of clay and a short partition of
boards. He knew that the lieutenant labored
therein over his reports, the small deal table
lighted by a dim oil lantern.</p>

<p>The officer in command looked up quickly,
but Herbert put his finger to his lips, even
before saluting. Then he spoke in a whisper.
"Do you sort of feel something in the air?
I don't know what makes me feel that way,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I reckon I've been feeling something of
the kind; yes," answered the lieutenant.
"At any rate, I didn't seem to want to get
sleepy at my usual hour. This sort of thing
bothers a fellow at times."</p>

<p>"I think we must hear things we don't
know we hear, or get a notion of them in
some way," offered Herbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, as a Southerner&mdash;and we are quite
religious in our parts, my boy&mdash;we give
the Almighty credit for that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course." Herbert sat, deeply
thinking for a moment. "Lieutenant, I have
wondered lately about the strategic wisdom
of our position here, to use the words of
Brigadier-General Harding and of Captain
Leighton, of our company. They often
gave us a talk about that. It has struck
me of late that a very few of us are defending
a point of great importance, one that the
Boches would like to capture and destroy.
How about that, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"A natural and a wise question, Corporal;
very," Lieutenant Jackson made answer.
"But rest easy. You came through at night
and could not see much on the way. Right
back of us, not a quarter of a mile and on
the other side of the ridge, one whole division
is in barracks, not in billets, as the French
term them, but in good, old American log
houses, shielded by sand bags on this side
and roofed the same way. And a mile beyond,
on each side, there are some more
infantry regiments; I don't know just how
many, but enough. And there must be
almost half a division in the trenches, nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
two in all, guarding this one quiet sector
and ready to start toward Berlin when the
order comes."</p>

<p>"I suppose putting these men in barracks
is to save crowding the trenches," offered
Herbert.</p>

<p>"Exactly; and it's a great scheme. But
even without them I have a large idea that
the Huns couldn't get enough men on this
ground to push us back an inch, much less
get our trenches. And heaven help them
if they try it!"</p>

<p>"We don't want them to get this gun pit."</p>

<p>"They'll have to go some to do it! We're
always ready for them."</p>

<p>"Might they not want to attack now,
especially; to recapture their general?"</p>

<p>"Let them come. Two of your men and
two of mine are out on the slope against
surprises. Three quick shots near will put
us wise and the 'phone will bring as many
as we want to help us in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Thanks for your information, Lieutenant.
I'm going to try to nap a bit. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, my boy. Some sleep we've
all got to have."</p>

<p>But as Herbert passed into the outer
corridor, he turned softly and in the darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
walked noiselessly away from his quarters
into the next hollow dug in the hill, this being
more enclosed and better roofed than the
others, as it was the store-room for ammunition.</p>

<p>The boy paused and stood for a long
time silently; why he did so he could not
then nor afterward have told. Surely there
seemed to be something in the air, though
he could hear nothing except the audible
breathing of sleepers on every side, the
scratching of the lieutenant's pen, the occasional
rustle of paper as one of the prisoners'
guards turned the pages of a magazine he
was reading and once the yawn of the other
guard as it drew near the time when he was
to be relieved.</p>

<p>These two guards, Herbert knew, were
in the center and at the far end of the section
where the Germans were confined; his own
man, Gaul, was nearest the partition of the
supply chamber.</p>

<p>The corporal settled back upon a stack
of hand-grenade boxes and leaned his shoulder
and head against the wall. He was as wide
awake and alert as a cat at night, but physically
tired, nevertheless. For he had been
through much the night before and since
and without a moment of rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Breaking in almost imperceptibly on the
night sounds the low mumbling of an indistinct
word or two came to his ears; the
prisoners talking among themselves, probably;
what else? Leaning forward, Herbert put
his eye to a very narrow opening between
the partition boards. The reading guard
had the back of his head turned that way;
the other man was nodding, half asleep, a
punishable offense. Squinting sidewise, he
saw a hand and arm reach out from the
other side of the partition and a hand reach
up from a man sitting on the ground at the
edge of the bunch of Germans. He had a
glimpse also of something white that passed
from one to the other.</p>

<p>Herbert almost stopped breathing; his
ears caught every fraction of sound that disturbed
the still air. Seconds, perhaps half
a minute, passed. Then suddenly a whispered
word:</p>

<p>"More!"</p>

<p>Again the hands met; again the white
thing passed.</p>

<p>"Right! I'll do that!" was again whispered.
Then the figure on the ground collapsed and
all was silent for a time. Herbert slipped
away into the corridor, waited a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
then walked noisily back to the prison section
and going straight to Gaul, standing by
the partition, said:</p>

<p>"I've been thinking you're not fit for duty.
I'll stand guard here awhile and you go back
to bed. Give me your gun and revolver."</p>

<p>"But I feel all right, Corporal," Gaul protested.</p>

<p>"I mean this as an order, Gaul."</p>

<p>The fellow handed over his weapons. Placing
them aside, Herbert covered him with his
own pistol. "Now, hand over that paper
you just received from the general here,
and be quick about it!"</p>

<p>Gaul went white and stammered:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't get&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't lie! Hand it over, or I'll bore a
hole through you! You hear me!"</p>

<p>"But, honest, I&mdash;you are wrong, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, then, blast your ugly carcass,
I'll just fill you full of holes and take it,
anyway."</p>

<p>Gaul, scared, visibly trembling even in the
dim light, with shaking fingers fished into an
upper blouse pocket and brought forth a bit
of scrap paper with torn edges and thrust it
at Herb. The corporal glanced at it, then
ordered his man to march down the corridor,
following to the lieutenant's quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please read that; it came from the
captured German general to this fellow.
He first asked for more, then agreed to do
something."</p>

<p>The officer held the paper near the lantern.</p>

<p>"It's a scrap torn from some book, I guess.
German print on it. Oh, on the other side.
What is it? Pretty poor writing, by jingo!
Wait; it says:</p>

<p>"'Set loose if men come. See as I shall
get loose of hand bands. Then see in fight
I escape free. Then come to trenches by
night and inquire by me, General von Lutz,
and I pay 5,000 marks quick and you mak
safe.' And down farther are more words:
'10,000 marks I will mak it; hav no dowts.'"</p>

<p>A broad, solemn-looking grin covered the
lieutenant's face and he nodded his head
several times.</p>

<p>"Might have expected this, really. Always
had my suspicions, but hoped otherwise.
Well," turning to Gaul, "did you really
think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you suppose, Lieutenant, that that
Dutchman could buy me, you fellows get
another think. I was only strafing him a
little. He wanted me to do this, but you
don't think I would? Why, Corporal, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
know me better'n that. Haven't I always&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Corporal, it would have been better to
have got up a pretended alarm and observed
what this man would really have done. But
I guess we have it on him all right, after
what you heard. Anyway, we'll send him
back when the patrol comes for the Huns.
Take him and put him under guard now."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Life and Death</span></p>


<p>The night wore on. Clouds overhung
the sky and it began to drizzle.
Roy Flynn, on duty in No Man's
Land, felt that in a little while he and Watson
would need their slickers and he was about
to return for them, believing that his comrade
and two others on the watch could be certain
of any improbable attempts of the Huns
to make a raid, when a strange thing
happened.</p>

<p>The ground was suddenly lighted up as
though by flashes of fire; a tearing, ripping
sound came to the two riflemen, and they
saw bits of earth, stones, grass, bushes, torn,
blown, lifted, and whizzing by them. Myriads
of bullets sung mournful snatches of
promised death and howled in derision of
life as they struck the rocky earth and bounded
onward.</p>

<p>"Back to the quarry! There's no place
like home!" yelled Roy to Watson, and firing
three shots into the air he turned to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
two Regulars who had also been out on the
slope running for the pit. Watson also
started and Roy felt conscious that, go as
they might, he would not be the last to get
under cover. And then suddenly he knew
he would be the last and as the pain in his
hip seemed to shoot up into his very vitals
he wondered, as he pitched headlong, whether
he would ever get under such cover again
as would protect him from the barrage.
Would he, indeed, have a chance to get
behind some very nearby shelter while the
innumerable bullets paved the way for a
German attack on the pit? And, even so,
would the coming Huns not find and kill
him?</p>

<p>It was hard going. He held to his rifle,
believing that it might be the means of
either saving his life or of avenging it at the
last moment. Once the barrel was struck
by a bullet that glanced harmlessly, but with
a wild shriek, as a flattened bullet will.</p>

<p>Then the stock was struck and splintered,
and even amidst the awful danger, the near
certainty of death in a veritable rain of lead,
the boy felt one swift regret for an injury
to his beloved weapon. Such are the vagaries
of the human mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Roy dragged himself forward toward a rise
of ground. It was terribly painful going,
but he must get out of this first; see to his
wound.</p>

<p>"If I've got to pass up, or down," he said
aloud to himself, "I want to do it according
to Hoyle and not as Hamburger steak or
mincemeat. Let us proceed where we can
estimate on repairs, if the works are worth it."</p>

<p>He got on, suffering from time to time bitter
stabs of pain just below his hip when his
limb twisted. Not able to lift the lower
portion of his body from the ground by his
uninjured leg because of the agony when the
other dangled he was compelled to drag
his entire weight on his elbows, gun still in
hand, but the lad's pluck and spirit never
left him.</p>

<p>"A turtle's got nothin' on me for getting
down to it. Wish I was a snake. Then I
could bite a Hun. Mebbe this little thing&mdash;"
thinking of his pistol&mdash;"might do it yet;
drat 'em! Here's this little old heap of
earth, and&mdash;oh, glory be! It's a shell pit!
Like home and mother! In we go! Whurrah!
That'n nearly got me!"</p>

<p>It had almost. A conical mass of iron
ripped clear across his back, cutting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
cloth like a knife, but doing no other damage.
The boy spread himself out, feeling a little
easier, and lay still for a moment. The cold
rain fell on his face and he pulled his hat over
his eyes.</p>

<p>"But ye don't sting quite like those Boche
hailstones," he said. "Well, I've luxuriated
enough now. Go to it, m'lad, and look to
your hurt. If not, the rain'll help to make
this slope all unnatural blue with me arterial
fluid; me ancestors way back to Brian Boru
would have it that it's as blue as indigo.
Better look to see the damage; but how
can I?"</p>

<p>How could he, indeed? Was there nothing
for him but to lie there and let his blood ebb
away, unless his comrades missed him in the
pit and the barrage fire ceased? And then
a fear seized him. Would they tell Herb
and would that loyal friend risk his life to
reach him?</p>

<p>The bullets fell thicker and faster now,
the rattle of the guns at the German trench
had increased and no man could steal out
from the pit and hope to survive. Perhaps
Roy could drag himself out again and up
the slope in time to keep his friend from
attempting&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy struggled to get his arms fully
under him and then to sustain the weight
of head and shoulders. But the former
effort had been too great; the reaction now
was final. He sank back on the soggy
ground and the hem of his blouse stretched
across the wound, his weight firmly holding
it. This and the coagulating effect of the
cold earth must have stopped the flow. But
the lad lay white and still, no longer gazing
up at the black sky, nor conscious of his hurt,
nor the curtain of lead and iron above and
about him.</p>

<p>"Flynn? Where is he?" was Herbert's
first question of the men who had leaped into
the welcome shelter of the pit.</p>

<p>Watson glanced around. "He was with
me; yelled to me. Must have been hit!
I was; my heel's off, and one hit my pocket
fair. And there's what's-his-name, wounded,
though he got in. Flynn must have been
hurt bad, or he'd made it!"</p>

<p>One of the Regulars limped away to his
couch, a bullet had cut his side and broken
a rib, but this was a minor matter. The
other man who had been out on the slope had
lost his hat; a shot had struck his gun also.
A barrage fire is truly a curtain of missiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
a shower of bullets that, like rain, reaches in
time every spot in the area against which it
is directed.</p>

<p>"You musn't go out, Corporal! My orders,
please! You couldn't live to reach Flynn
now, and he may be dead or out of harm's
way in some shelter."</p>

<p>"But, Lieutenant, think of it! He may be
suffering, dying out there, unable to help
himself, bleeding to death! If I could only
try to reach&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! A thousand times no! You are too
useful here; have done too much of value
already to run a risk of that kind. Just wait
a bit until our fellows down there in their
trench start a fusillade. I wish Letty could
get at his gun and perhaps he can."</p>

<p>And Letty did. The telescopic-looking
weapon stood on a revolving iron base at
such a height as to be within zone of the
enemy's fire when the gun was being used;
and though it took but an instant to elevate,
aim and shoot with accuracy under ordinary
conditions, it now was likely to be pelted
thoroughly by the barrage. So Corporal
Letty called on his men to sand-bag the gun
clearance space, standing by to pull bags
away where he would indicate it; this gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
him a chance, after he had timed his fuse, to
slip in a shell, elevate and let her go straight
at the line of barrage guns.</p>

<p>"There goes Susan Nipper at last!"
exclaimed Smith, who was a reader of Dickens
and had named the big gun after a noted
character in "Dombey and Son," which
name stuck.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a few of them placed like Letty
knows how to place 'em will fix their feet
good and proper. Hit 'em again, old girl!"</p>

<p>And the old girl did. She was a termagant,
altogether too violent of tongue and
slap to suit those "laying down the barrage,"
as they term it, and after a lot of the German
machine and rapid-fire gunners, who had
believed they were so strafing the Americans
as to have rendered the big gun useless, had
felt the effects of her bursting shells even
fifty feet away, they lay down on their jobs.</p>

<p>But this was only a little sooner than they
expected to do it, anyway. As soon as the
firing ceased, out of their trench and up the
slope came the Boches, more than two
hundred of them to oppose less than quarter
their number in the pit. But the pit boys
were on the job.</p>

<p>It took the clumsy, heavily-booted Huns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
quite a while to get up the slope and Susan
Nipper paid them some compliments as they
came, but when ordered to do a certain thing
by their superior officers they tried hard to
do it, or they died trying.</p>

<p>Yes, they died trying, and the Americans,
experienced now in the fighting game, saw to
it that this program was carried out.</p>

<p>Two things the Boches had for an objective:
the recapture of their general, made a prisoner
the night before, and the destruction of the
terrible gun of American manufacture.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jackson lifted the little 'phone
in his quarters and spoke quite calmly into it.</p>

<p>"Jackson talking. North side gun pit.
The Germans are coming; from the sound
and what lights we have been able to use I
think there are a great many of them. You
heard the barrage, of course. They're hot
foot after these prisoners of ours. Better
come a-runnin' some of you and if I might
be permitted to suggest it, have a company
or two make a detour over the hill and below
the pit; this might cut off the Huns when
they go back and get a good many of them.
What's that? Oh, yes. We can hold them
awhile. Eh? Sure! Good-by."</p>

<p>Rapid orders quickly followed, the Regulars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
however, knowing well their places and having
already had experience in repulsing two small
raids, much to the enemy's discomfort. But
Herbert's squad was a little green in the
matter.</p>

<p>"Get your men out there on their bellies,
on the hillside, so you can pick off all the
Huns you can get a line on! Letty, got your
Colt spitters placed? Good! Now, boys,
line up at the trench and use your guns first,
but hold your bayonets till the very last;
they'll outnumber us, as you know. Make
use of your revolvers; that's the game!
Every man of you ought to be good for about
four Germans at close range, counting the
misses. A revolver will reach farther than
a hand grenade or liquid fire. Give it to
them a little before you see the whites of
their eyes and make every shot tell! Go to it!"</p>

<p>They went to it, with a muffled cheer that
the Germans must have thought was an
expression over a game or a joke, perhaps;
anyway, it seemed apparent that, until two
powerful searchlights were thrown upon the
advancing enemy, they had believed they
were taking the Americans entirely by
surprise.</p>

<p>But when the beams of light suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
glared upon them, to be followed instantly
by the staccato of the three machine-guns
and the crack of rifles, the first phalanx of
Teutons became demoralized for a moment,
with more than half their number struck
down.</p>

<p>The second rank also had suffered, but
their purpose now was a big one and with
that dogged determination for which the
German soldiers under training and supported
by each other in close touch are noted, rather
than a dashing bravery that sweeps all before
it, they rallied and returned to the charge.</p>

<p>On they came again, in open formation,
and at a run, the darkness enveloping them,
except when the flashes of gun fire illuminated
dimly the surroundings. For they had
instantly shot out the searchlights and their
objective was now the black hillside in the
center of which they knew the gun pit and
dugout lay. And they meant to penetrate
that spot and wipe it out past further injury
to them.</p>

<p>Is it not best, even when the most graphic
recital seems necessary in the portrayal of a
battle scene, to draw the mantle of delicacy
over those details of horror that follow a close
conflict between forces long trained and
superbly fitted to kill?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>It suffices to say that the Americans found
their Southern leader, experienced in the
choice of weapons with which man can do
most injury to his fellowman when he so
desires, was right concerning the revolver as
a most effective means of defense and offense.</p>

<p>Even in the dark the pet American weapon
worked wonders. An arm drawn back to
hurl a grenade or bomb was pretty sure to
drop limp, with its owner down and out, and
a flashing bayonet in the hands of a chap
tumbled over by the same means was hardly
a weapon to be feared, even against vastly
inferior numbers.</p>

<p>After the machine-guns and rifles had performed
their work the ready revolvers, each
hand holding one trained in its use to practical
perfection, did a work that was more murderous
than anything the Huns had so far
witnessed.</p>

<p>It is not pleasant to think even of enemies
going down in such numbers. The death of
one man, forced into a death grapple by the
red-tongued furies of war, is enough to draw
pity from all who are humane, but when
dozens, scores, in the space of a few minutes
are made to suffer and die for a cause not
rightly known to them, and others also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
because of the inhumanity of a power-mad
despot, it is beyond the full telling.</p>

<p>If the raiders were slaughtered and turned
back from their purpose, they did not make
their effort entirely in vain, as was proved
shortly after the Americans had seen the last
of the dusky backs of the remaining Huns
disappearing down the slope and the defenders
of the pit had turned to take account of the
results.</p>

<p>When they counted their own dead and
wounded, could they be greatly blamed for
being overjoyed upon hearing, half way to
the German trenches, several more shots
fired and a clear American voice call out:
"Surrender, all of you!"</p>

<p>The lieutenant's suggestion had been
adopted and all that were left of the raiding
companies, fully a hundred men, were cut
off in their retreat and so swiftly disarmed
and thrust back over the hill that no rally
to their relief from the farther trenches could
be made.</p>

<p>But however ill the wind that had blown
those raiding Huns to the attack of the gun
pit, leaving death and suffering in their wake
and many more of their own to care for, it
was indeed ill if it blew no good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>Part way down the slope a German helmet,
knocked from the head of a soldier boy by a
fateful bullet, rolled into a certain shell pit
and lay by a prostrate form.</p>

<p>In the retreat, with the glare of a renewed
searchlight upon them, the vengeful Huns
would have thrust a bayonet into every one
of their enemies that might possibly have
been alive, but the helmet deceived them;
this must be one of their own who had fallen
in the first fire. And so they went on.</p>

<p>After the supporting force and their
prisoners had gone to the rear, there crept
into the renewed blackness of the night
figures that searched everywhere for the
unfortunate.</p>

<p>"Here's a Boche, Corporal, that looks as if
he was asleep, not dead. A young fellow,
from the get-up of him, but can't quite see
his face. Red-headed&mdash;and, hello, look
here!"</p>

<p>Herbert, with his one free hand, the other
having had a Boche bullet cut across the
thumb, flashed the electric torch on the
occupant of the shell pit. Then, with an
order, he was down on hands and knees and
with knowing fingers feeling for possible
heart beats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bring a stretcher, quick, two of you!
It's Flynn! Dear old Roy! I believe he's
alive! Yes, yes; he's still alive! Come on,
you fellows, quick!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wing Shooting With a Rifle</span></p>


<p>The blessed, the brave, the indispensable
Red Cross! Just back of
the pit, exposed to the vicious
German fire and yet intent only upon the
duty of mercy, the panting ambulances were
being loaded with their precious, their pitiful
human freight soon to be billeted in warm,
clean, homey hospitals far in the rear where
German shells, even from the biggest guns,
might seldom reach. And laboriously through
the mud the springy cars went away, one at
a time.</p>

<p>"Herb, I'd like to have been with ye to
help stop those devils, but I couldn't. And
if ye can't, how can ye? Now I mebbe never
can. It's a fine, good, hard, tryin' old world,
it is, Herb. As me old granddad in Ireland
used to say: 'Whurrah, me lad, but life's
mainly disappointin'.' I know what they'll
do to me, me boy. They'll leave me go
round as if I was playin' hop scotch as long
as I live, but faith, no longer. Me leg'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
have to come off, Herb; I know it will. But
what of it? It's all in the game."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, Roy, old man; I think
not," the corporal made answer, sick at heart.</p>

<p>"Come see me at the hospital, Corporal,"
groaned Smith, rolling his eyes, that told of
suffering, toward his chief. "That is, if I'm
still sticking round there when you can get
relieved. If I'm still above ground I'll look
for you."</p>

<p>"Say, Corporal, I want to thank you for
being good to me; always jolly and kind, even
when I felt like grumbling. Will you do me
a big favor? You see I can't write with this
arm; never can, I guess. Won't you just
drop a line to dad and mother? You have
my home address and it would come better
from you than anybody else; and you might
say that I didn't run and hide when the Boches
were coming. I think dad always believed
I would do that. Will you?" Such was
Geddes' request.</p>

<p>And all Herbert could do was to take their
hands and press them, nod rather violently
and perhaps get out a very few words like:
"Oh, you'll be all right. See you later."
Had he attempted more he would have quite
broken down; and that, he believed, would
not have been exactly the part of a soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>They were gone and the boy turned to his
chief. "Lieutenant, there's only four of us
left out of the nine; one dead, three wounded,
one a traitor. This is war! But there's
something more to be said; it is, how to get
back at those devils down yonder? Of course,
we're after them, too, but they had no business
to start this war."</p>

<p>"I don't think those poor chaps did start it
and I don't believe the most of them would
have started it, either, if they'd had any say
in the matter. They are mere puppets, even
the higher commanders, working in a vile
system that makes monkeys of them at the
behest of their ambitious and conscienceless
rulers, or the one ruler, Kaiser Bill. But as
long as these fellows have made their bed as
practical slaves, let them lie in it as victims,
however the fortunes of war may swing, and
we have to teach them a lesson about coming
over here too readily; got to get back at
them.</p>

<p>"To-morrow the communicating trench
between our pit and the lower trench will be
completed; that is a less distance across No
Man's Land and some of us can join those
boys down there in a counter-raid to-morrow
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"And, Whitcomb, don't be too down-hearted;
I see you are. Those fellows will
mend up and we must expect some to be killed.
We lost seven in all and eleven wounded.
What is left of you can do very efficient work
yet. The Huns are not done sniping and I
will ask for some more men to refill your
squad, along with two other squads of our
command to take up the losses. And say,
my boy, keep your eyes open for enemy
airplanes; it'll be good flying weather in the
morning and I've a notion they'll try again
to do what the raid failed in. But Susan
Nipper will wing 'em if she gets a show!"</p>

<p>It turned out precisely as the lieutenant
predicted. The morning dawned clear and
still, like an Indian summer day in the dear
old United States and the men in the pit and
those in the trenches below praised heaven
for smiling upon them and Old Sol for drying
up a bit of the bottom ooze where the trenches
were poorly drained. The pit did not suffer
so much, being on high and sloping ground
where, even had the bottom been level and
not drained, the rain water would have soon
seeped away.</p>

<p>Herbert and Watson went out on the slope
to watch for snipers in the early morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
But no snipers were in evidence and, strangely,
they were not shot at even once; at that time
this section could truthfully be called quiet.
Not so?</p>

<p>Well, considering that one airplane engine
makes as much noise and keeps it up longer
than the shooting of a machine-gun, and that
now no less than three airplanes made their
appearance low down and came on at a
tremendous rate, the quiet sector suddenly
took on a different character. And then
Susan Nipper commenced to talk out loud
and to do things spitfire fashion.</p>

<p>At the very first shot, timing the shell fuse
long or short, the foremost plane was hit
precisely in the center; a long range wing
shot with a single projectile at that. The
German taube went to pieces and to earth as
though it had been a dragon-fly smashed with
a brick-bat, and there could hardly have been
enough of the propeller and engine left to
take up with a pitchfork. As for the poor
driver and bomber, they passed into the other
world without knowing a thing about it.</p>

<p>But this was no check to the other machines,
for the quality of mind that makes or permits
a man to go aloft at all makes of him no
coward under any circumstances. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
two came, straight for the side of the hill,
at such a furious speed that Corporal Letty
had time only for one more shot at them.
Hastily timed, this was a clean miss, the shell
bursting high in the air beyond. And the
gun squad was making a record to get in
another shell as the machines, one a little
above and behind the other, swept almost
over the pit.</p>

<p>Two of the gun squad were working the
Colt rapid-fire gun now, but they did not
seem to swing it fast enough, all their stream
of missiles being wasted.</p>

<p>Watson, farther down the slope than Whitcomb,
now held to his shoulder a rifle that
was hot with repeated action, and yet he, too,
had scored no hits. Though an airplane, if
not over three hundred feet in air and flying
steadily ought to be scored on, its height
makes it look mighty small and hard to hit,
and moving objects are no cinches for a single
bullet. As the disappointed fellow stopped
to slip in still another cartridge clip he heard
a yell from Herbert.</p>

<p>"Lookout, Watson! Dodge!"</p>

<p>Watson did dodge just in time. He saw a
conical-shaped thing descending toward him
and, a baseball player of skill with an eye for
sky-scraper flies, he gauged correctly where
that thing was going to hit and he got away
from that place. And when the thing did
hit and tore up the earth and gravel and
stones Watson was glad he had dodged.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">
<a name="ill3" id="ill3" href="images/i04large.jpg"><img src="images/i04.jpg" width="390" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption smcap">He Fired Twice in Quick Succession.</span>
</div>

<p>Another was flung down at him, but it
went wide, and a third was started toward
Herbert, who stood, spread-legged, gun to
shoulder.</p>

<p>There is an art in aiming at a moving
object that probably estimates its speed and
direction, the speed of the bullet and allows
for all of this. Herbert's skill with his little
.22-caliber at objects tossed in air stood him
in good stead when at rifle practice in the
training camp and, however excited and eager
with the necessity of shooting straight, it
did not fail him now.</p>

<p>He fired twice in quick succession, meaning
to hit exactly under the fish-like belly of the
machines, directly below where he knew the
driver sat and the first shot he believed he
had missed. He felt pretty sure of the other;
he even thought he saw the direct result of
it in a glare of light, a shower of jumbled
sparks and stars, and then, there was sudden
blackness.</p>

<p>"What in thunder&mdash;how'd I get here?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a><br /><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
was the corporal's question of Lieutenant
Jackson, who stood over his cot, smiling a
little. But that was not an important matter
just then; there were big comments being
saved for Herbert's return of wits.</p>

<p>"Great Jupiter, my boy! By jingo! I
never saw shooting like that! None of us
ever did! The next minute they would have
played havoc with things in here. Letty
couldn't get at them and Watson couldn't
and not one of my men, but <i>you</i>&mdash;oh, <i>you</i>
could beat Doc. Carver! Wonderful!"</p>

<p>"Say, if you'd make it a little clearer to
me I'd know what you're referring to," Herb
protested. "Let's see; it was&mdash;oh, yes; I
think I remember: taubes, weren't they?
Where'd they get to?"</p>

<p>"They got to earth, you bet! Can't you
recollect? You must have been worse stunned
than I thought. You got 'em both, boy;
got 'em both. Hit the first one so that it
went down into the hill above and your
second bullet started something going in the
hind machine and it blew up and tossed those
two fellows out and it turned turtle. She
lies out there, looking more like a dump heap
at home than anything else. You were hit
by a fragment. You're a dandy!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are that!" echoed Letty, from the
opening. "I'll bet those Boches down there
will study awhile before they send on any
more fliers here! Feel better, Whitcomb?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much. Head aches. Any bones
busted? Guess not. Sore in spots, though.
Well, getting out in the air and sunshine
would feel better. Want to see what
happened," said Herbert, rising from his cot.</p>

<p>"Wonderful! Wonderful shooting!" repeated
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yes, and four Boches the less!" declared
Letty.</p>

<p>"Is it true? Poor fellows!" said Herbert.</p>

<p>"Poor nothing! They'd have got my gun
if you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hadn't murdered them, poor chaps!"
put in Herbert. "This business of killing
makes me sick. But I must get out; they'll
be sending others to drop some more bombs."</p>

<p>"You're a queer chap," said Corporal
Letty, and Lieutenant Jackson once more
reiterated: "Wonderful shooting! Wonderful!"</p>

<p>But the Germans sent no more airplanes
over on that day, nor many a day thereafter;
they are brave, but rarely foolhardy. And
as they appeared to have lapsed into inactivity
for a time, probably seeking some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
surprises to spring, it seemed up to the
Americans, true to their reputation for originality,
to do some more surprising themselves.</p>

<p>The day wore on uneventfully. Watson
and Herbert were replaced on the slope of
No Man's Land by Gardner and Rankin, and
the latter once so far forgot himself as to walk
uprightly for about ten yards. Whereupon
half a dozen whiz-bangs, or very light shells,
from a small rapid-firer, came his way. Letty
saw whence they came, trained Susan on that
whiz-bang slinger and it went out of commission,
along with three men working it.
Rankin, meanwhile, had hunted cover.</p>

<p>Reinforcements arrived, as asked for.
They were Regulars and more than anxious
to get into the fighting, the actual work of
getting into touch with the enemy. And,
expert with revolvers, they were chosen for
the night's work.</p>

<p>Herbert went to the lieutenant. "We
fellows all want to get into this thing. We
know something about work with pistols;
perhaps we are as handy with them as with
rifles. It's a cinch that we can do some
good."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jackson hesitated. "If we
lose any more of you boys, and you in particular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Whitcomb, we won't be as sure of
holding off attempts to get at Susan Nipper.
But, nevertheless, this once, as it is to be an
effort to demonstrate pistol work almost
exclusively, I expect you fellows ought to be
included. Sergeant West is to command;
Corporal Gerry will lead. There will be
about forty men and they will start from the
lower communicating trench at about three
o'clock to-night. Each man will carry two
revolvers only, and six more rounds of ammunition
and go as light as possible. There
will be no barrage, as we want to surprise
them. So be ready."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Over the Top</span>"</p>


<p>Had the entire bunch of fellows, from
Regulars to Draftees been planning
for a football game or a very strenuous
social lark of some kind, they could not
have appeared more happy, in the beginning,
over it. The fact that the raiders had first
in mind the killing of the enemy, men like
themselves sent to cut down their opponents,
proved what custom will do. For custom is
everything, and men in a body can fit themselves
to observe almost any procedure and
to twist it whichever way that gives the
greatest satisfaction.</p>

<p>In times of peace we regard the murder of
one person as something over which to get
up a vast deal of excitement and much indignation,
but in warfare we plan for the killing
of thousands as a business matter and read
of it often with actual elation. Such are the
inconsistencies of mankind.</p>

<p>"Say, Corporal, if I don't get at least a
half dozen of those Huns during this little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
picnic you can call me a clam! These little
get-theres have got to do the job!" Rankin
stood gazing lovingly at his two service
pistols, held in either hand, as he spoke. He
was admittedly the best revolver shot amongst
the gun-pit contingent.</p>

<p>"I'll run you a little race as to who makes
the best score on real deaders!" spoke up a
youthful-looking fellow who was one of the
recently arrived squad of Regulars. "I sort
of like to punch holes with these small cannons
myself."</p>

<p>But Herbert heard no other boasts of the
sort from the men contemplating the night
raid; indeed, there was very little talk about
it at all, except that some were curious as to
how the program might work out, or what
the hitches might be, and some, though
determined to do their duty, seemed to be
a bit nervous as time went on.</p>

<p>The boy, having now gone through enough
in the crucible of death-dealing to sear him
against the fear of possibilities, even of
probabilities, regarded this raid only as a
matter of duty, of necessity, and with very
little thought about it, resolved to do his part
to the very best of his ability.</p>

<p>"Over the top!" This has become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
familiar phrase now since a large part of the
present method of warfare consists in those
in the opposing trenches finding a way of
getting at each other over No Man's Land,
often not more than twenty yards across and
on an average perhaps a hundred and fifty
feet, though the turns and twists of the
trenches make it difficult to draw an average.</p>

<p>Open attacks, except by large bodies of
men in what is termed a drive, are not generally
successful in the military, the strategic,
sense, for there are more men lost in getting
across barbed wire entanglements, machine-gun
and rifle fire than will pay for what they
gain. A section of trench which is part of
the enemy's system will very likely have to
be given up, unless the entire trench is soon
after taken, which may result in a general
drive.</p>

<p>The military tactics compel that which the
scientific boxer adopts and calls his art, that
of self-defense. Anyone can wade in and
hammer a foe if he does not care how he is
hammered in turn, but often the hammering
he gets is more than he can give, unless he
studies to shun injury. In this case often the
weaker fighter will outdo the stronger if the
former avoids being punished while getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
in some hard cracks on the other chap's
weak spots.</p>

<p>And just so with trench fighting. The
opposing armies are precisely like two trained-to-the-minute
prize fighters with bare knuckles
and out for blood; they are watching each
other's every move, dodging, ducking and
delivering all sorts of straights, hooks, swings
and upper-cuts, all sorts of raids, bombings,
grenadings, shellings, air attacks and what
not?</p>

<p>But the raids at night are the best card
that, so far, the opposing platoons or companies
have learned to deliver, and they often
result in a knockout blow, at least to that
section of the trench attacked. The raid
must be delivered as a surprise to be most
effective and thus may be compared to the
fist fighter's sudden uppercut or swing to the
jaw.</p>

<p>The night came on cold, still, with gathering
clouds, and the men in the lower portion of
the communicating trench, and mostly within
an offset that had also been dug and roofed
over with heavy poles, brush and sod for
camouflage, gathered to partake of the evening
meal and converse in low tones.</p>

<p>Two enemy airplanes bent on scouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
duty, started just before dusk toward the
American lines, but with glee the boys heard
Susan Nipper begin to talk again and the
planes disappeared, one veering off out of
range, the other being knocked into the
customary mass upon the unkind ground.</p>

<p>Whitcomb, Gardner, Watson, and Rankin
chummed together, as was their habit when
all off duty together; not at this time cooking,
as there was no place handy where a fire
could be camouflaged. The men now all
ate their grub cold, which was not so bad for
an occasional change; the tinned meats,
fresh fruit and fresh biscuits made at the
barracks well satisfying a soldier's appetite.</p>

<p>Hot coffee in a big urn was sent down from
the gun pit, and the lieutenant added a good
supply of chocolate candy recently shipped
over from the good old United States for the
boys in the trenches and appreciated as much
as anything could be. After this many
indulged in pipes and tobacco, but they were
careful to keep the glow of their smoke well
out of sight of the prying eyes of the enemy,
for who can tell when a squirming Hun may
wriggle himself up to almost the very edge
of his foeman's trench and spot those gathered
within, or overhear their plans!</p>

<span class="caption smcap">"Maybe I'll Hear Them Pronounce My Doom."</span>
</div>

<p>All this while there had been someone at
the listening post, that point of the zigzag
trench which was nearest the enemy. The
job is an exacting one and the listeners are
frequently relieved by those men most alive
to the interests of the trench.</p>

<p>Presently Sergeant West came to the snipers
and addressed Whitcomb:</p>

<p>"Corporal, you fellows are all wide awake
and with your eyes sharpened. I'd like to
have one of your men on relief at the listening
point."</p>

<p>"All right. Rankin has got ears like a
rabbit for hearing, even if he is a pretty boy.
Go to it, old man!"</p>

<p>Rankin got up and stretched himself. He
seemed more than usually serious.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll hear them pronounce my
doom," he remarked and turned away.</p>

<p>"He seems extra solemn tonight," said
Gardner. "Wonder if we'll all come out of
this business skin whole."</p>

<p>"All? I'll wager not all of us will. Those
Huns can fight; I'll say that for them. But
it's the only good thing I can say for them,"
Watson commented.</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong, old man,"
Gardner replied. "As you know, I spent a
year in Germany&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a><br /><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or in jail? 'Bout as leave!" Watson
jested.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash; after I left school. Dad sent me
over with our buyer to get on to the toy
importing business, and I'll say this for the
doggone Germans. They are rough, they are
brags, they are all a little crazy; but they
are wonderfully painstaking, remarkably
thorough and persevering, and here and there,
now and then you come across some mighty
fine, good, upright, altogether decent chaps
whom you may be glad and proud to have as
friends. It is all wrong, unfair and a little
small to consider all the people in any land
unworthy; don't you think so? You remember
what Professor Lamb used to say at
school&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Professor Lamb?" interrupted Herbert.
"Say, man, what school did you attend?"</p>

<p>"Brighton Academy. Best school in
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, too! I was a junior when I enlisted;
Flynn and I. Put it there, old chap!"
Herbert thrust out his hand.</p>

<p>"Now, isn't that funny we didn't know
that before about you?" Gardner said. "Yes,
Watson here and I were classmates. We were
chums at school, and have been chums ever
since; enlisted together."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"And we're mighty glad to be under one
who has the same Alma Mater," put in
Watson.</p>

<p>"Or, as poor old Roy Flynn would say:
'We're all the same litter and bark just
alike; mostly at the moon'," Herbert quoted.</p>

<p>"Flynn, too, eh?" questioned Gardner.
"He, like many another fitted for some very
different task, came out here to be unfitted.
I have thought, ever since the days in camp
back home, that he was admirably cut out
for the law."</p>

<p>"A man doesn't need both feet to talk
with," Watson suggested.</p>

<p>"And he may not lose his leg at all,"
Herbert protested, hoping against hope.</p>

<p>"It won't still his tongue, I'll wager, if he
does."</p>

<p>As the night wore on conversation grew
less and many of the men dozed, sitting on
the ground and propped against the dirt
wall, or each other. One little fellow slept
and even snored lying across the stretched
legs of two others, until they tumbled off to
rest their limbs. Others knew only wakefulness
and either stood about or paced up
and down between the narrow walls of the
trench, stopping now and then to exchange a
whispered word with their fellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>The sniper squad took turns in making
pillows of each other. Once, when they
were shifting positions for comfort, Watson
remarked rather sharply:</p>

<p>"We can't yell 'Hurrah for old Brighton!'
but we can all pull together, by gum!"</p>

<p>Rankin, who had been in turn relieved from
duty at the listening post and who was very
wide awake, remarked:</p>

<p>"Mebbe we'll all pull together for the other
shore before this night's over."</p>

<p>Herbert waked up at that. "Pull yourself
together, old man. You were telling a while
ago what you're hoping to do with those guns
of yours and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I have any sort of a chance," Rankin
said grimly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We can't call you fellows together with a
bugle," Sergeant West announced, in a stage
whisper. "But it's a few minutes of three
o'clock; everything is as quiet as a mouse.
Two of our men are over there to give an
alarm. All get ready. There'll be no falling
in, no formation. Keep well spread out.
Orders will be given only by signals. Three
of us have whistles and we hope they won't
get all three. One short blow means follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the leader; two means all return; three means
retreat in a hurry, but with prisoners, if you
can get them; a long-continued blast means
retreat for your lives. I guess all understand.
But no signals will be given until after we
attack. We must go across absolutely without
noise and we must go quickly. Get the
fellow at their listening post, or any sentinel
first. It's our first raid in this sector and
they will hardly expect us. Now, boys,
follow Gerry. He knows the lay of the land."</p>

<p>And over the top went the forty odd,
wishing they could do so with a cheer, but
keeping as silent as an army of cats after an
army of rabbits&mdash;only the prey they sought
was by no means as harmless as rabbits, and
this fact made the need of silence greater.</p>

<p>Not a word came from the scouts, and if
the men in the enemy's trench were apprised
of the coming of the Americans they were
not able to communicate with their fellows
before the raiders had scrambled through, or
rapidly pulled aside the barbed wire,
squirmed over a pile of sand bags and leaped
into the German trench.</p>

<p>Not a man hesitated, and the first signal of
any kind they heard was the bark of Gerry's
revolver as he sent down the foremost and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
lone Hun he encountered just as the fellow
tried to raise his gun.</p>

<p>At short range the handier, expertly used
revolver won and it was so throughout the
mêlée that followed.</p>

<p>As the Americans landed, some few dashing
on and into a wide shelter or dugout lined with
berths and concrete-floored, in which fifty
men reposed or waited for night duty, the
short, sharp, rapidly repeated bark of the
ready pistols sounded almost like, though
less regular than, a machine gun.</p>

<p>But the revolvers were used only against
those that opposed them; the foeman who
indicated surrender, who was without a
weapon or who dropped it, or who held up
his hands was fully disarmed and pushed
aside between guards, quickly signified by
Sergeant West.</p>

<p>It was not all surrender, however; at the
very rear of the dugout a dozen men quickly
leveled their Mausers and discharged a volley,
point-blank, at the Americans who had
entered, the most of them being still in the
trench fighting the Huns who had rallied from
either end.</p>

<p>The snipers' squad, all light and active
young fellows, had been the first into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
trench; the first into the dugout, they were
in the fore when the volley came. Herbert,
a gun in both hands, leaped to prevent two
Germans from seizing their guns; Gardner
on the other side held up three men; Watson
blazed away at a commander who blazed
away at him, without making a hit, and half
a dozen Regulars behind were coming on to
perform a like duty. But it was Rankin who
saw more of the resisting squad at the far
end of the dugout.</p>

<p>The young man, a gun in each hand, became
transformed instantly into a sort of fire-spouting
mechanism; the red streaks of flame
from his weapons stabbed the semi-darkness
almost with one continuous glare and when
the twelve shots were expended every man
of the opposing force had fallen. But not
alone! The last to stand before that burst
of fury aimed true; and as more Regulars
rushed into the place to make good the surrender
of the other Huns some stumbled
over brave Rankin's body.</p>

<p>The whistle sounded once, twice, thrice.
Was the work so soon completed? That
meant hurry, but with prisoners and, of
course, the American wounded and dead.</p>

<p>As though long drilled for this work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
knowing precisely what to do and being not
once confused, the boys hustled the Huns
before them, some guarding against any
possible flank attack; and Herbert, feeling
for the moment like a young Hercules, lifted
Rankin over his shoulder and, climbing again
the ramparts of the enemy's trench, staggered
rapidly back again over No Man's Land,
keeping up with his comrades. And a little
behind him came other stalwart fellows,
carrying also their precious human burdens,
some groaning, some quiet, two limp and
fast growing cold.</p>

<p>Then came rest, though there was readiness
against counter-attack, which did not then
occur. With the coming of dawn a few new
men guarded the communicating trench and
the raiders returned to the gun pit. Herbert
listened to Sergeant West's terse report to
Lieutenant Jackson:</p>

<p>"Very successful, sir. Captured twenty
and left about thirty-five enemy dead and
wounded. Two of ours dead; four wounded.
Got a lot of their guns and smashed a machine-gun
they were trying to use in the trench."</p>

<p>Then he added in an altered voice:</p>

<p>"Want to recommend every man for
bravery, but especially Corporal Whitcomb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Privates Gardner and Watson for holding the
dugout against odds until more men arrived,
and Corporal Long and Privates Finletter,
Beach, Thompson and Michener for capturing
the machine-gun. If I may mention it, we
would all be glad to make another raid at
any time."</p>

<p>Herbert saluted. "May I add to that,
Lieutenant? Thank you! I want to tell you
what Rankin did before he died." And with
a voice a little unsteady at times the boy
related briefly the heroic work of the young
fellow who had shot faster and truer than
eight or nine men against him and had made
it possible for the few Americans in the dugout
to take the prisoners they did.</p>

<p>"I think this, more than anything that has
occurred yet, shows clearly the superiority of
the Americans' expertness with the revolver
and what may be done with it against odds,
if men are taught to shoot accurately and
with great rapidity," he added.</p>

<p>"I am going to report that to our captain,"
said Lieutenant Jackson, "and I hope it goes
to Washington. I know what I'd do if I had
the say. I'd give each man two pistols and
a lot of training and omit a lot of this liquid-fire
business and grenades. A poor shot can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
do nothing, nor can a man attempt it who is
unfamiliar with the weapon, but an expert
could stop half a dozen men with bayonets
before the latter could get near enough to
use them."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Herbert's Little Scheme</span></p>


<p>"Keep an eye open for anything the
enemy may spring on us," cautioned
Lieutenant Jackson, at the
daily conference of the officers under him,
their men now occupying the gun pit and the
trench near, which had been enlarged from a
communicating trench. In all there were
now a platoon and three squads of new men.
"They have all sorts of schemes. We must
have only the sharpest-witted fellows at the
two listening posts," continued the commander.</p>

<p>"For this duty I would like to pick Corporals
Whitcomb and Kelsey and Privates
Marsh, Ferry, Drake and Horn, with two
others that may be selected later. Experience
and practice will do the best work in this duty
and it will be well for you men to arrange
regular watches, as they do on shipboard.
Whitcomb, I know you are thinking of sniping
duty, but send your two men out on that,
alternately, and you will have some time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
it also. Yes, go ahead, Corporal. Got
another idea?"</p>

<p>"I was just thinking this might work, Lieutenant,"
offered Herbert. And briefly he
outlined a scheme that made the rest of those
present open wide their eyes. It was a little
bit of strategy that was worth trying.</p>

<p>"Fine, fine!" declared the lieutenant.
"They'll be most apt to attack the trench and
you can work it best there. Get ready for
tonight; it'll be as dark as pitch. Sergeant"&mdash;to
West&mdash;"you are in command in the trench,
but in this case give the matter over to
Whitcomb and the two of you can put it
through according to his plan. We shall
look after the gun up here with half our men
and I'll ask Lieutenant Searles, beyond, to
back you up on that side. So, go to it,
men!"</p>

<p>The carrying out of a strategic move in
the army is nothing like that in any other
organization; the action is settled by one or
two heads, planned in detail by whoever is
put in command, and the rest merely follow
orders. West, Whitcomb and Townsend
went at the matter with all the energy they
could show and the help of some others who
were handy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Just before dark a German airplane, reconnoitering
high in air, and purposely let alone
by Susan Nipper, discovered a long section
of the trench very poorly guarded and
manned. This ruse, if not found out as
such, is an instant temptation to a raiding
party, and the Germans are never slow to
seize an advantage.</p>

<p>Massed and ready at one end of the trench
near the gun pit, West's and Whitcomb's
men were waiting patiently, and in the dugout
were more than a dozen stuffed figures
posed as though sleeping, a few others
propped standing in the trench. A small
number of bombs were set to go off with the
pull of a string.</p>

<p>The Germans came across silently, a
hundred strong, prepared to inflict all the
damage they could and to capture prisoners;
especially to capture prisoners, for there
were promotion and the Iron Cross ahead for
those who could bring in Americans.</p>

<p>Hidden in a shell hole, almost in the middle
of No Man's Land, his head covered with
bunches of grass, and thus successfully
camouflaged, a volunteer spy from out of
the ranks heard and saw the Germans dash
across and into the American trench and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
at once gave the signal to the waiting fifty.
Without a second's hesitation they went
over the top and dashed toward the enemy's
trench section, to which the spy led them, he
having been able to tell from what direction
they had come.</p>

<p>Herbert led the men and without much
trouble they found the breach in the wire
through which the raiders had come. Swiftly
the Yanks ran forward, leaped over the sand
bags down into the trench, and an astonished
German on duty there got tumbled over so
quickly that he knew not what hit him.</p>

<p>Corporal Whitcomb instantly comprehended
the exact situation and to further
carry out his plan acted accordingly. To
the left a right-angled bend led to a communicating
trench that could be held by half
a dozen men; a little to the right of this
another cut led to an elaborate shelter, a
guard to which had been standing in the
entrance-way. To a dozen men Herbert
ordered:</p>

<p>"In there, quick, and hold them up till
you hear the signals, and don't come out
until then!"</p>

<p>The guard had alarmed those in the dugout,
who were the remaining men of the trench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
contingent off duty and sleeping, and the
Americans had a lively time of it, but of that
nothing was known until later.</p>

<p>"Here at the bend line your men up!"
Herbert said to Sergeant West, "and fire
when I signal! Carey and I will watch
them."</p>

<p>Finding nothing but stuffed figures, the
German officer must have suspected a trap
in the American trench and he signaled his
men to return quickly. This they did,
retreating across No Man's Land exactly as
they had come. Hidden behind sand bags
a little to one side of the wire breach, Herbert
saw them come and he waited until twenty-five,
or more, in a bunch had leaped into
the trench.</p>

<p>At Herbert's signal a volley rang out at
the trench bend, followed by groans and
curses from the Germans. By this time
others, thinking only of getting back into
shelter, and not comprehending that their
enemies were within the German trench,
leaped in also and met much the same fate.</p>

<p>Those not yet in the trench began a retreat
along the inner line of wire entanglement and
over the sand bags away from the shooting
and going into the trench at a point farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
along. Here they must have encountered
more of their fellows and at once formed a
plan of reprisal. Anticipating this and also
an attack from the other side over the more
easily sloping rear of the trench, Herbert
leaped back, gave the signal as agreed upon
for the retreat with prisoners, and the men got
busy. There were a dozen or more of the
enemy unhurt in the trench.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Germans in the dugout
had put up a fight, and had thrown some
hand grenades at the entrance among the
Americans, with the result that some of the
attacking party of a dozen must have been
put out of the business of active participation.
The others had begun to shoot, rather at
random, but largely accounting for those
who had attempted to resist; and then, as the
Americans were about to round up their
prisoners, some brave, foolhardy or fanatic
German managed to set off a box of bombs or
grenades, enough explosives to upset an
average house.</p>

<p>But one man, Private Seeley, came out of
that volcano able to tell what happened;
two rushed out into the trench to fall on their
faces, blinded and dying. Within was a
holocaust of flame, smoke and poisonous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
gases presiding over the dead and dying,
Americans and Germans alike.</p>

<p>Sergeant West and Corporal Whitcomb
reached the crumbling entrance and tried to
gaze within.</p>

<p>"We must get our boys out!" began
Herbert.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" protested West.</p>

<p>"Let's try! There may be some alive&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not one! Let's get out of this!"</p>

<p>"You detail squads at the ends of the
trench to fight to the last man and give me
a rescuing party&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No use, Corporal. You can see that.
We shall be outnumbered and hemmed in
soon. We've got to go!"</p>

<p>"Gardner and Watson are in there!"</p>

<p>"Dead as mackerels! They'll stay there
forever. Come, now; we must go back!"
With that Sergeant West blew the signal
again, and the men, with no wounded, but
rushing a number of prisoners, turned once
more to retreat.</p>

<p>And then the thing happened which Herbert
had expected, in part, and had planned to
circumvent: a rally of reprisal had been
started. But not being sure of their ground,
the Huns had meant, in turn, to cut off the
Americans by another detour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Carey had been left on guard outside of
the wire. Paying little attention to what
might be going on in the trench, he had
followed the German survivors and he had
seen and heard them return to No Man's Land
and reach a place of ambuscade. This was
along the line of some tall Lombardy poplar
trees, that had probably once been a farm lane,
and the spot was easily noted. Directly past
it the Yanks must go to regain their trench.</p>

<p>Carey's speedy progress toward his comrades
was hardly marked by caution. His
information was received by West and Whitcomb
with as much elation as they could show
in the face of the loss of their companions in
the dugout. This was no time for sentiment;
only for action.</p>

<p>"Follow me, men; double file as much as
you can and pussy-foot it for keeps!" Herbert
ordered, caring no more for technical terms
than do many other officers when bent upon
such urgent duty.</p>

<p>West ordered three men to conduct the
prisoners straight across to the gun pit.
Carey indicated the line of trees. Herbert
led his men to a point fifty yards behind the
trees; then he went to West.</p>

<p>"You order the charge, will you? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
inspire the men more than I. I will give you
the signal again, this time the soft whistle
of a migrating bird."</p>

<p>The Germans heard a low, plaintive call
come from somewhere near; some might
have suspicioned it; others hardly noticed
it. But almost immediately afterward it
was followed by such a yell that the enemy
must have believed Satan and all his imps
were on the job. Perhaps they were.</p>

<p>What followed was another mêlée; the
Huns, being unable to swing their several
machine-guns around, turned with rifles,
bayonets and grenades to find their foes
upon them, the revolvers of the Americans
spitting fire quite as usual. The Huns were
being mowed down most disastrously and in
less than half a minute they were separated,
beaten back, thrown into confusion, overpowered
in numbers, disarmed and completely
at the mercy of their superior and more
dashing adversaries. Again the ready and
effective revolvers had won.</p>

<p>"Back to our trench! March! Double
quick!" shouted Sergeant West.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"A success, men; a success! I cannot
give this too high praise in my report. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
worthy of being imitated. The men in the
dugout were unfortunate; you couldn't help
that. It is terribly hard to foresee anything,
and no one would have been to blame if the
whole scheme had failed. You only did your
duty magnificently! And, Whitcomb, the
credit for the idea belongs to you. We will
have to term you our Lord High Executioner."</p>

<p>"Please don't, sir!" the boy protested.
"We may have to do this sort of thing in the
business of fighting, but I wouldn't care to
have it rubbed in."</p>

<p>The lieutenant laughed. "Well, at any
rate, your scheme, though it practically wiped
out your squad, and you are the only one left,
must have accounted for at least ninety of
the Huns, in dead and wounded, and you
took fifty prisoners. Not bad out of perhaps
two hundred men in that section of their
trench!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Big Push</span></p>


<p>Susan Nipper was talking very loud,
very fast, and she had need. The
Germans had started something toward
the American lines and gun pits&mdash;a cloud of
something bluish, greenish, whitish and altogether
very ominous. It was a gas attack.</p>

<p>On the other side of the hill Susan's sister,
and still farther beyond another one of the
same capable family, were also talking loud
and fast and very much to the purpose, so
that wherever their well-timed shells reached
the gas-emitting guns and machinery the
terrible clouds, after a moment, ceased to
flow out and the atmosphere and the sloping
ground became clearer and clearer.</p>

<p>Then, all that the American boys had to
do was to put on their gas masks for several
hours and burn anti-gas fumes, the Boches
having been put to a lot of trouble and much
expense for very little gain; one or two
careless fellows were for a time overcome.
After that there was a wholesome contempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
for the gas on the part of the boys from over
the ocean.</p>

<p>But Susan kept right on speaking her mind.
As the gas men retreated from the field in a
terrible hurry they got all that was coming to
them and many had come on that did not go
off at all, unless upon litters.</p>

<p>Then, Susan paid her respects to aircraft
of several kinds that had come over, not on
scouting duty, but to drop their bombs here
and there. There was a regular fleet of
aircraft planes, or it might seem better to call
a bunch of them a flotilla, or perhaps a flytilla.
Anyway, they made an impressive sight,
though not all coming near enough for
Susan to reach.</p>

<p>Most of the enemy airplanes went on,
despite the guns aimed at them from the
earth, until, sighting a number of French
machines coming out to do battle, they
strategically fell back over the German lines,
thus to gain an advantage if they or their
enemies were forced to come to the ground.</p>

<p>The Americans had not before witnessed
such a battle in the air as that. The birdmen
turned, twisted, dived, mounted, maneuvered
to gain advantage, French and German being
much mixed up and now and then spitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
red tongues of flame, singly or in rapid
succession, at each other.</p>

<p>Two machines were injured and came to
earth, one German, that descended slowly;
the other French, that tumbled over and
over, straight down. Then two other German
planes were forced to descend, and, finally,
others coming from far behind the lines, the
French retreated, being much outnumbered;
they had to be outnumbered to retreat from
the hated Boches. And the Boches did not
follow them up.</p>

<p>This had all happened soon after daylight,
the different incidents following each other
rapidly. It was hardly eight o'clock when
Susan Nipper let fly her last shell at the airplane.
Before noon a messenger arrived at
the pit, and Corporal Whitcomb was sent for.</p>

<p>"My boy, they must be aware of you back
there at headquarters. You know you have
been mentioned in dispatches a number of
times as resourceful, altogether fearless,
capable in leadership and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you sufficiently&mdash;"
Herbert began, but the lieutenant
shut him off.</p>

<p>"Don't try it, then! Merely justice, fair
dealing, appreciation, recognition of worth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
We aim toward that in the army; military
standards, you know. Well, as I was going
to say, there is a general advance ordered, in
conjunction with our Allies. We want to
push the Huns out of their trenches and
make them dig in farther on, somewhere.
If the attempt is successful, the engineers
will place Susan in a new pit somewhere
ahead. But the main thing you want to
know is what your duty will be."</p>

<p>The lieutenant settled back with a half
smile; half an expression of deep concern.</p>

<p>"They expect us fighting men in the army,
and in the navy, too, I suppose, to have or to
show not one whit of sentiment. We are
expected to be no more subject to such things
than the cog-wheels of a machine. But they
can no more teach us that than they can teach
us not to be hungry, or to want sleep. I have
begun to think, of late, that they don't expect
us to sleep, either.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, if you would like to see an
example of military brevity I will show it to
you. Ahem! Corporal, report to-night to
regimental headquarters, with your company;
Captain Leighton, Advanced Barracks.
By order of Colonel Walling.</p>

<p>"But hold on! Here's a little of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
absence of military brevity. It appears that
they so admire your record back there at
headquarters that they have picked you out
for almost&mdash;no doubt you think me pessimistic,
or a calamity howler&mdash;for almost
certain injury or death. My boy, I wanted
you to stay here with me until we are relieved,
which will be soon, but now they are going to
take you away from me. An old man like
me&mdash;I am getting on toward fifty&mdash;gets to
have a lot of feeling in such matters. He
likes to think of his military family, of his
boys, and becomes more than usually attached
to some of them. But let that pass.</p>

<p>"They're going, I am told, to put you on
special scouting duty before the drive. Of
course, you'll go and glory in it, but, my
boy&mdash;Well, good luck to you; good luck!
If you get out all right, look me up when we
are all relieved. Look us all up; the men
will all wish it."</p>

<p>Herbert's leave taking of the pit platoon
and the squads in the adjoining trench, that
night, was one that was more fitting for a lot
of school cronies than hardened soldiers bent
upon the business of killing. But human
nature is human all the world over and under
pretty much all conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>That night, in the half light of a moon
darkened by thick clouds, and in a cold,
steady rain, Corporal Whitcomb journeyed
with a patrol and on an empty ammunition
lorry back again toward the rear, though not
far. After bunking in the one empty cot in
the barracks of a former National Guard
battalion and messing with same, he reported
to Captain Leighton, of his own company.
He was received with a more than cordial
handshake.</p>

<p>"It's a pleasure to see you again, Whitcomb,
especially after what we have heard
concerning you. And you are the last man
of your squad; the one survivor! Well, I
learn that was not because you tried to save
your skin. We have lost a good many men;
sniping is one of the very hazardous things.
The plan now is to form new squads as fast as
we can get the men in from the trenches and
they will be assigned to new points, mostly.
You will be given eight other men, but we
want you for special duty. The British have
sent us a tank; one of these new-fangled forts
on wheels, or belts, or whatever they call them,
and it is to blaze a certain trail, to be followed
by an armored motor car in which your squad
will travel right into the enemy's lines. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
car has trench bridges to lay down anywhere.
Reaching an advanced spot, hereafter to be
indicated and where a mine is to be laid, you
will guard this from attack until a counter-drive;
then fall back and set the mine off at a
signal."</p>

<p>"Are we to carry any other weapons
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only your rifles and pistols, and, of course,
gas masks. No packs. There will be tools
to dig you in and the car will carry all supplies.
Perhaps the spot will not be attacked at all;
perhaps it will be overwhelmed at once. In
the latter case you are to use your own
judgment about the setting off of the mine.
You want to hold the enemy back until a
large number attack you."</p>

<p>The general drive was ordered. The Allied
armies were to attack almost simultaneously
and over the frozen ground of winter, rain or
shine, snow or blow. The firing of big guns
and smaller guns from the Cambrai sector
to the Aisne indicated to friend and foe alike
what must be the plan. After some hours of
this, when half of those in the German trenches
had been made nearly crazy by the incessant
hammering and many had been killed, the
great push was on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Germans were wise to the purpose.
There had been other mighty drives launched
against them, some to force them back a few
miles and to win their first, second and even
third line trenches; some to win nothing at
all; some to be pushed back a little here and
there, in turn, showing what a deadlock it is
for armies of great nations to battle with
those of others long and splendidly prepared.</p>

<p>But this was a new thing in drives; it was
fully simultaneous; it was launched in the
early part of winter when the ground was
frozen hard to a depth of several inches, to be
broken up by the tramp of men over certain
spots, the dragging of heavy ordnance, the
armored cars, tanks and motor trucks, until
in spots there was a sea of mud, holding back
the advance to some extent, but still bravely
overcome by pluck and persistence.</p>

<p>And there were several new schemes
launched, largely the result of American
strategy and suggestion.</p>

<p>Herbert knew all of the men in his new
squad; they had all qualified as snipers at
Camp Wheeler and otherwise he approved of
them. A bunch of athletic chaps, skilled
with rifles and revolvers and having already
known the baptism of fire, were to be relied
on in any emergency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Not one of them ever forgot that motor-truck
ride. They forged along over rough
and rocky ground, through muddy and oozy
ground, even through bits of swamp and,
following the great, lumbering tank a hundred
yards ahead, they plowed through once
prosperous farmyards, along the street of a
ruined and deserted village, seeing only a cat
scamper into a lone cellar, through orchards,
that had once blossomed and fruited, but with
every tree now cut down by the dastardly
Boches.</p>

<p>Finally, still following the iron monster
that was now spitting flame, they crossed the
empty trenches of their Allies, putting into
use the grooved bridge planking on which
their wheels ran as over a track, and then
came to the first line trenches of the enemy.
Whereupon things began to get interesting.</p>

<p>On either side was orderly pandemonium;
a concentrated Hades with motive, its
machinery of death carried out with precision,
method, exactness of detail, except where
some equally methodical work of the enemy
overthrew the plans for a time.</p>

<p>Long lines of infantry in open formation
were running forward, pitching headlong to
lie flat and fire, then up again and breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
into trenches, shooting, stabbing with bayonets,
throwing grenades and after being half
lost to sight in the depths of the earth for a
time, emerging again beyond, perhaps fewer
in numbers, but still sweeping on.</p>

<p>Here and there were machine-gun squads
struggling along to place their deadly weapons
and then raking the retreating or the standing
enemy with thousands of deadly missiles,
sometimes themselves becoming the victims
of a like annihilating effort or the bursting
of a well-directed enemy shell.</p>

<p>Herbert rode with the driver; and before
them and all around them the heavy sheet-iron
sides and top of the armored truck protected
them from small gun fire.</p>

<p>It was a risky thing to peep out of the gun
holes in the armor to witness the battle, but
this most of the boys did, the driver by the
necessity of picking his way, and Herbert's
eyes were at the four-inch aperture constantly.</p>

<p>Just behind him Private Joe Neely knelt at
a side porthole, and next to him came young
Pyle and Bill Neely, brother of the before-mentioned
Joe. Cartright, Appenzeller, and
Wood occupied the other side, back of the
driver. Finley and Siebold lay on the straw
in the center and hugged the water keg and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the boxes of explosives and food to keep them
from dancing around at too lively a rate on
their comrades' feet.</p>

<p>The going was as rough as anything that
a motor truck had probably ever tackled,
especially a weighty vehicle of this kind. It
was well that the car had an engine of great
power, an unbreakable transmission and a
driver that knew his business.</p>

<p>On swept the great push, seemingly as
irresistible, for a time, as the waves of the
ocean, but presently to cease on the shore of
human endurance; and the battle, so called,
came to an end almost as quickly as it had
begun five hours before.</p>

<p>Over the ground won the Americans and the
Allies generally were digging in anew, or utilizing
and refortifying the conquered German
trenches. Once again were the great armies
to face each other across a new No Man's
Land the old area having been reclaimed.</p>

<p>But the active fight was not over, for then
came the enemy's counter-thrusts here and
there, which, as important as winning the
battle proper, must be checked by every
means possible. It was the plan of the
American commander and his staff to teach
the Boches a lesson in more ways than one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Along the British sector the tanks, as
formerly, had done wonderful work; the one
tank with the American troops had also
fulfilled its mission. It had ridden, roughshod,
over every obstacle, crushing down
barbed wire entanglements, pushing its way
across trenches, its many guns dealing death
to the foe on every side. In its wake and not
far behind it the armored truck had followed
faithfully the trail thus blazed by the tank.</p>

<p>At one spot, in line with a bend of the first
line trench, a Hun machine-gun had let go
first at the tank and then at the truck, doing
no damage to the former. The boys in the
latter hardly knew at first what to make of
the direct hitting and glancing bullets that
pattered on the iron sides, but they took
quick notice of one that came through a
port-hole and rebounded from the inside.
It caused some commotion.</p>

<p>"Hey there, you chump! You don't need
to dodge now; it's done for!" shouted Appenzeller,
addressing young Pyle.</p>

<p>"Sho! Ye might think it was a hoop
snake come in here 'stead o' nothin' but a old
piece o' lead," remarked Cartright, and there
was a general laugh.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Joe? Here, man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
do you feel sick? Say, Corporal, reckon he's
got it!" called Finley, with one hand trying
to hold Neely from falling backward, the
fellow also trying to hold himself up.</p>

<p>Herbert swung round; Bill Neely was
beside his brother and talking to him:</p>

<p>"Say, Joe, are you hurt? How, Joe?
When? Just now? Blast them devils!
Mebbe you ain't bad, Joe; you only think so.
Lots do."</p>

<p>"Stop the car, driver! Here's where we
leave the track of the tank, anyway, I take
it," ordered Herbert, getting down to business.
"Where are you hurt, Neely?"</p>

<p>For answer the poor fellow placed his hand
on his back; then suddenly fell limp in his
brother's arms. Bill began to mumble over
him.</p>

<p>"He isn't dead, Bill; he's just fainted,"
said Herbert. "We must get him back, Joe,
somehow, to a hospital. But there are no
ambulances following us this closely. And
we must go on, whatever happens; those
are our orders."</p>

<p>"Corporal, let me take him back!" Bill
Neely made the request pleadingly. "I'll
get him there somehow and then I'll come
back and find you. I'll find you. I've got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to put some lead into them Huns to get square
for Joe, if he dies! Will you, Corporal?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, then, Bill. Slide that bolt and
push that door open, Wood, and help get Joe
down. Poor fellow! I hope he isn't badly
hurt. Go straight for that bunch of pines,
Bill, and you'll be pretty safe. If you come
back bear off to the right a little from here
and you'll find us pretty soon. So long, old
man!"</p>

<p>Bill Neely with his brother humped over
his shoulder, started back, as directed; the
great armored car went on. Herbert told
Wood to peep out back and watch Bill's
progress, if he could, and the car progressed,
as indicated by his orders. He had reached
what he believed was a proper place, hardly
two hundred yards from where they had
stopped; he was ordering all out, the supplies
unloaded and the driver to return, when Wood
called to him:</p>

<p>"They're both gone! Wiped out! Shell!
It hit right at Bill Neely's feet! I couldn't
see anything but legs and arms and things."</p>

<p>"Killed?"</p>

<p>"Done for."</p>

<p>"Poor chaps! The only two boys in the
family, too. Their poor old mother'll miss
them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Know them, Pyle?"</p>

<p>"Sure; since we were kids. Just across the
street."</p>

<p>"Well, men; it's terrible, as we all know,
but we've got to hustle if we don't all want to
suffer the same fate. Get out those trench
tools, Appenzeller, and give me a pick!
We've got to dig in quick!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Whitcomb</span></p>


<p>The great push had served a big
purpose; it was to be followed by
others quickly. In this manner it
was hoped to strike the most effective blows
at the enemy, giving it little time to recover.
It could not be expected, however, that the
Germans would take the matter at all calmly;
they must be met with two blows to their one.</p>

<p>The place that Herbert had chosen was a
small natural depression of a few feet; a pile
of stones and hastily filled sand bags helped
this much until a trench, really a nearly
square hole, had been dug. Then this was
roofed over with some half-charred planks
and boards brought from a nearby pig-sty
which the Huns had tried to burn, but could
not.</p>

<p>Herbert and Cartright succeeded in throwing
some earth on the roof without being hit
by shells and other gun fire that had begun
to come their way and they were delighted to
notice that an anti-aircraft gun, undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
well guarded, had been installed not a fourth
of a mile back of them, insuring much safety
from that quarter, at least.</p>

<p>When night fell half the squad went on
guard outside; the others worked like beavers,
and without food until the task was done, to
successfully camouflage the shelter, using
grass and weeds pulled up by the roots from
the half frozen ground and placed upright
on the roof. The entrance down earth steps
was made through the dead-leaved branches
of a large uprooted bush.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with Cartright as his most
skilled assistant, Herbert was placing the
fifty pounds of explosives in a large niche cut
in the side of the pit and guarded by stakes,
from which spot, under cover of darkness, a
wire was laid for fully four hundred yards
and the battery that was to set the charge off
was buried in the ground and the spot marked.</p>

<p>The Germans did not seem at first to pay
much attention to the pit until the final act
of camouflage. A messenger, at night,
sneaked to the pit and informed Corporal
Whitcomb that it was deemed advisable
to take this step now, as from airplane observations
the previous day the Huns were
getting ready to make a heavy counter-attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>At once, therefore, a flexible steel flag-staff
was firmly planted beside the pit and from it,
with the first streaks of the coming day, the
enemy viewed a division staff headquarters
flag and a signal station flag flying in the
sharp breeze. Then the shells flew, but the
flags also kept right on flying. The steel
staff was struck and shaken again and again,
but its tough flexibility saved it; the flags
showed many a hole, but still they fluttered
proudly and the Boches went mad.</p>

<p>Snipers tried to down the banners and
incidentally pick off a few of the supposed
officers and observers that must grace such a
spot, but the squad of American experts with
the rifle was more than ready for them and
they quit that game both through the day
and the night following. Perhaps because of
this or the night-long bright moonlight, no
raid was attempted; perhaps it was because
a bigger move was in process of formation.</p>

<p>And on the next day the enemy launched a
mighty counter-thrust to regain lost ground.</p>

<p>A barrage fire was laid down and it continued
for a full hour. Private Wood took
it upon himself to make some observations
as to how the flags and staff were bearing this
and he got too far above the shelter with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
his head. There are those who will do,
against all sane judgment, most foolish,
unnecessary things, and Wood was one such.</p>

<p>Sad, indeed, was every member of the
squad as all stood about with uncovered heads
and placed poor, uncoffined Henry Wood into
a hastily dug grave in the bottom of the pit,
Finley, a minister's son, stumbling, half
bashfully, over a short prayer.</p>

<p>Suddenly the barrage fire was lifted and
over a wide front the Huns were coming.</p>

<p>"Get out, fellows, and back, or they'll
catch us! We can outrun the best of them,
but do it! Stick together, if possible, but all
report later to Captain Leighton! Cartright
and I are going to wait for the Huns and set
off the mine."</p>

<p>The men all filed out through the birch
branches and retreated straight back toward a
certain spot, each waving a small American
flag, as per agreement with the men in that
section of the trench. But Appenzeller and
Finley protested. The former uttered nothing
less than a command.</p>

<p>"Corporal, let's stand and soak it to 'em
for a little! We can reach 'em from this rise
nicely as they come over the hill, and I'm
good for about a dozen. Finley is, too. We
all are!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, in its sporting sense, this sort of
thing appealed to Herbert and, moreover, he
must have regarded it as a duty. A little
good shooting would undoubtedly account
for a good many of the Boches. But he and
Cartright could not join in, as they had a
more important duty to perform. But the
others might do as they pleased.</p>

<p>"You fellows that want to, try it on them,"
he said. "We will have to leave you. But
don't get caught or headed off! Go to it!"</p>

<p>Herbert and Cartright ran to the wire end.
The corporal stood with the battery in his
hand, watching through his field glasses the
doings of the enemy. The Huns could not
pass what they believed was a headquarters
and signal station without, at least, an
investigation. They swarmed toward the
flag and pit from their advancing lines, no
doubt believing they were to receive a warm
reception and intent upon taking important
prisoners.</p>

<p>The young American corporal was conscious
of a greater degree of excitement than he
had ever experienced before and with it there
was uppermost that gentle humanity that
makes a better man, even of a soldier.</p>

<p>"They're rushing up, Cartright! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
they're a little puzzled, perhaps. They think
they're going to get the very devil presently
and they're preparing for a rush. It will be
awful, old man! Say, how do you feel about
it?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to blow the whole bunch up so
high that they'd stick fast up there; clean
beyond our attraction of gravitation! And
I'd like to see the Kaiser and old Hindenburg
in the bunch!" growled Cartright.</p>

<p>"Well, say, then, you take this battery and
spring it! I guess I'm chicken-hearted. It
seems like murder, but of course it's war."</p>

<p>"You bet I'll spring it! Give the word;
that's all! Say, what's going on over yonder?
For Heaven's sake, Corp; look there!"
Cartright almost shrieked the last word.</p>

<p>And Herbert, for a moment forgetting his
first duty, gazed where the other's hand
indicated.</p>

<p>The four had been putting in their best
licks, as it were. No doubt but that they
had reduced the number of approaching
Germans, four hundred yards, nearly a
quarter of a mile distant, and their guns
must have been hot. But sweeping forward
on the other side of a rise of ground, a place
also hidden somewhat by hedges and battle-ruined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
buildings, a large body of the enemy
came suddenly almost between the four and
any chance they had to retreat in that
direction.</p>

<p>That also offered the only chance the boys
had to withdraw in safety, for almost at the
same instant a rapid-fire gun had discovered
them; and to try to get away over the clear
ground directly behind them would have
proved certain death. And so, stooping and
looking back, they made straight for the
hedge and saw the unintended trap too late.
In a moment Hun soldiers, detached at a
command and running forward on either side,
had surrounded them. There was nothing to
do but surrender.</p>

<p>With a groan Herbert turned back to the
important business in hand. There were
now no scruples in his heart as to performing
any acts of war. The whole business is merely
one of retaliation, anyway, from first to last.</p>

<p>"There they are, a whole company or
more, right on the spot! And some are down
in the pit! Spring it, old man; push it!
Ah! It worked! Poor devils! They could
not have expected that. Come, we've got to
beat it!"</p>

<p>The retreat of the two was largely made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
under the cover of a little natural valley,
somewhat thicketed. In only one place were
they exposed: while crossing a narrow bit of
open field. They were hardly half way across
it, Cartright, also an athlete, running just
behind Herbert, when the corporal heard
again that well-known sound that a bullet
makes in striking a yielding substance, in
tearing through flesh. A little moan followed
it.</p>

<p>Herbert stopped and turned. "Hit, old
man? Where?"</p>

<p>"Go on, Corp! Get out of this, or they'll
get you, too!"</p>

<p>"And leave you? Not for all the Boches.
Arms all right; are they? Get 'em around
my neck and hold on! Honk, honk!"</p>

<p>It was a long, hard struggle. The wounded
man, the last private of Herbert's second
squad, was a heavy fellow. Herb was still
unhurt, and he managed, though sometimes
seeing black, to get into cover again, and
there he could go more slowly, though he
dared not stop. It seemed like hours, perhaps,
instead of minutes, and the torture of struggling
on and on with a weight greater than
his own upon his back appeared a thousand
times worse than anything of endurance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
he had ever known on gridiron or long distance
runs. Still he kept right on going, with ever
the thought of the avenging Huns behind.</p>

<p>And at last he knew not how far he had
progressed and had begun almost to lose
interest in the matter, having the mad desire
to get on and on, fighting another mad desire
to rest and ease his straining muscles, when
in his ears welcome sounds were heard.</p>

<p>"Drop him, fellow! You've done enough.
We'll take him. Hey, Johnny, I guess we'll
have to carry both of 'em!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not an hour later Herbert saluted Captain
Leighton in the trench. The rapid firing of
guns, big and little, was everywhere; the
counter-attack of the Boches had successfully
been repulsed and the new drive was scheduled
to take place, following another and very
terrible barrage. The captain grasped the
boy's hand.</p>

<p>"Splendid work, Whitcomb! Put out of
business about two hundred of them; let her
go just at the right time. Cartright has
given me an account of it. And your bringing
him in was great! No; he isn't badly
wounded. Gone back; left grateful remembrances
for you. But that's not the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
in hand&mdash;feel all right now? Good! Well,
then, I have been empowered to brevet a
lieutenant for this platoon; Loring was
killed yesterday. I have chosen you and
you ought to know why; reasons are too
numerous to mention. Your commission
will arrive soon. Probably you'll be the
youngest commissioned officer in the army.
Well, come with me."</p>

<p>They walked down the trench, stopping
here and there where the officers of squads
waited with their men for the word to "go
over the top and at 'em!" To each group
the captain's words were pretty much the
same:</p>

<p>"Men, you all know Whitcomb and you've
all heard of his work. He's your commanding
officer now, lieutenant of this platoon. The
order to advance now will come in about ten
minutes, I think."</p>

<p>A low cheer, intense with feeling, with
expectation, with eagerness, greeted these
words; there were mingled expressions of
approval of their new leader and the idea of
again going forward against the Germans.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Whitcomb never could remember
much about the new push. He went with
his men over the top; they charged in open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
formation again across the country over
which he had come back with poor Cartright.</p>

<p>They cut and tore aside wire entanglements;
they faced and overcame machine-gun fire;
they encountered long bursts of liquid flame
and with rifle and revolver fire at short range
finished the devils who dealt it. They leaped
over piles of sand bags and into trenches,
using only their pistols against a brave
attempt to meet them with bayonets, and
when all of the Huns in the first line had been
accounted for or made prisoners the Americans
went up and on again, always forward.</p>

<p>And then the gas. It came at them like a
small typhoon of white and blue smoke,
showing again the iridescent colors, the gray-black
center of its spreading force, and this
time there was no Susan Nipper to disperse
the poisonous fumes with her fiery tongue
lashes sent into their midst.</p>

<p>Herbert knew the awful danger that confronted
them and he feared that his men, with
only the lust of battle in their eyes, hardly
comprehended it. He turned and dashed
down the line.</p>

<p>"Your masks, men! Every man get on his
gas mask! Keep your wits about you! Get
on those masks in a hurry, but get them on
right! You're down and out, if you don't!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Bent on saving his men, bent on disproving
Captain Leighton's half-jesting comment as
to his luck with a command, he forgot for
the moment his own safety, his own mask,
and the fumes were upon them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Captain Leighton rose with difficulty from
the bountifully spread table and looking about
him at the kindly faces, seeing the broad,
gentle humor of his host who had asked a
few words from him, he said:</p>

<p>"You good people here at home, though
you read and hear of these things and try to
imagine them, can really have no adequate
conception of them; of the hardships, the
discomforts, the cold and the lack of sufficient
rest amidst constant dangers and the almost
continuous hammering of guns. And then,
when in battle&mdash;well, no poor words of mine
can picture it.</p>

<p>"You, Mr. Flynn, and you, Madam, the
proud mother of this boy"&mdash;the captain stood
with his hand across Roy's shoulder&mdash;"would
feel a thousand times more proud if you could
fully know what he went through when he
lost his limb. And with a spirit like his, this
loss cannot dim for one moment the usefulness
of the lad in the world's activities. He will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
be doing his duty wherever he sets his&mdash;foot,
as he did with both feet in and out of the
trenches. I saw this even more plainly when
we three came over, invalided home, in the
good ship <i>Ingomar</i>.</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. and Mrs. Flynn, I want to
call on my young friend here on my other
side, as you know, your son's dearest friend,
to say a few words to these charming guests
who are so appreciative. Though his eyes
are slightly and permanently impaired as a
result of a gas attack, though he cannot again
enter the ranks, the country thereby being
the loser, his energies also are not diminished.
Most of you know him&mdash;some of you well&mdash;Lieutenant
Whitcomb."</p>

<p>Herbert rose slowly, awkwardly, protestingly,
his face, behind the big, round,
new spectacles, very red.</p>

<p>"I always have to thank Captain Leighton,
late the captain of our company, for the
kindness of his words concerning me. I have
tried many times to express this to him, but
talking is out of my line, as you can see.
What we did over there was just all in the
game; that's all. We bucked into the
fortunes of war; it's a sort of accident, a sort
of on-purpose accident, all the way through.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
It's duty first and it's all the time a concentrated
Hades.</p>

<p>"But why always look at the dark side of
this? It's going to be a better world after
this war; a better understanding between
nations. Everyone agrees to that. America
will be the model upon which the nations will
run their governments, and no people will
want to fight, except for a just cause. If
everybody feels like that, as the United States
feels about it, why, then, nobody can make an
unjust cause and wars will be over and done
away with. Thank you; thanks!</p>

<p>"I want to say one thing more, and this is
entirely personal. It concerns our host and
hostess and their son, my chum. I want to
thank them all, publicly, for something they
have done for me. Oh, yes, Roy, old man, I
will say it. While I was away over there and
getting these eyes bunged up, and all that,
Mr. Flynn here took it upon himself to inquire
into my affairs with my guardian. It seems
that instead of being a beggar, I am not quite
that, and now, Mr. Flynn is my guardian.
And so Roy and I, next term, go back again
to dear old Brighton and take up our studies
where we left off. That's the best news I can
tell you about ourselves, if it interests you at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
all, and I know how Uncle and Aunty Flynn&mdash;that's
what I call them now&mdash;feel about it.
Roy can tell you far better than I could ever
express it just how he and I feel about it."</p>

<p>Herbert sat down, still red of face, and Roy
was up instantly, leaning on his crutch, but
his old self seen in his round, freckled face.</p>

<p>"Whurrah! as me old granddad used to say
over in Ireland. Eh, dad? This boy here
can't talk as well as he can shoot and scrap,
and so you can see what kind of a soldier he
was. There was no danger he feared; no
duty he shunned; no gentleness he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, blarney!" escaped from Herbert.</p>

<p>"Bedad, you see it! Modesty is his only
sister and if you say 'hurrah for you!' to him
he wants to fight. But though I never would
have gone over and lost this leg if it hadn't
been for him, yet I'd do it again, and if I'm
a bit sorry for it, I'm glad of it. So there
you have it and it's the way we soldiers all
feel!"</p>

centuries. They are told in simple,
graphic style and each one is illustrated
with a beautiful color plate. The work

subjects for the illustrations were
posed in costumes of the nation and
time in which each story is set and
are unrivaled in rich color, lively
drawing and dramatic interest. 320

<p>The most beautiful book of fairy tales
ever published. Thirty superb colored
plates are the most prominent feature of
this new, copyrighted book. These plates
are absolutely new and portray the times
and customs of the subjects they illustrate.
The subjects were posed in costumes of
the nation and time in which each story is
set, and are unrivaled in rich color, lively
drawing and dramatic interest. The text
is original and interesting in that the
famous fairy tales are taken from the folklore
and literature of a dozen principal
countries, thus giving the book its name.

charming book. 8vo. 314 pages.</p>

<p>This work is authoritative, interesting,
and so popular as to appeal to
everyone. Since the earliest days
science has recognized the fact that
handwriting is an index of character
and placed reliance on the deductions
from it. Criminals have been punished
and accused men set free on the
strength of a scrap of handwriting.
Knowledge of this interesting science
is imparted in a simple but thorough
manner in this new work by a recognized
expert, and will prove of great
value not only as a source of entertainment,
but of business men, lawyers, students, bankers and
collectors of autographs.</p>

<p>An authoritative work giving the
fundamental principles in the language
of the hand in a clear and concise
manner. The study of Palmistry is a
most interesting and entertaining subject
to those who make it a study and
to those to whom it may be told. The
author has been a student of the hand
and its lines. After digesting the
many works of authorities on the subject
he has added many facts of his
own observation, presenting the principles
of Palmistry in a <b>new manner</b>
and with a unique system of showing
the principles of the art, by illustrations
of the human hand which is
<b>easily understood</b> and committed to
memory.</p>

<p><span class="large">N</span>either as a writer does he stand apart from the
great currents of life and select some exceptional
phase or odd combination of circumstances. He
stands on the common level and appeals to the universal
heart, and all that he suggests or achieves is on the plane
and in the line of march of the great body of humanity.</p>

<p>The Jack Hazard series of stories, published in the late
<i>Our Young Folks</i>, and continued in the first volume of <i>St.
Nicholas</i>, under the title of "Fast Friends," is no doubt
destined to hold a high place in this class of literature. The
delight of the boys in them (and of their seniors, too) is
well founded. They go to the right spot every time. Trowbridge
knows the heart of a boy like a book, and the heart
of a man, too, and he has laid them both open in these books
in a most successful manner. Apart from the qualities that
render the series so attractive to all young readers, they have
great value on account of their portraitures of American
country life and character. The drawing is wonderfully
accurate, and as spirited as it is true. The constable, Sellick,
is an original character, and as minor figures where will
we find anything better than Miss Wansey, and Mr. P.
Pipkin, Esq. The picture of Mr. Dink's school, too, is
capital, and where else in fiction is there a better nick-name
than that the boys gave to poor little Stephen Treadwell,
"Step Hen," as he himself pronounced his name in an unfortunate
moment when he saw it in print for the first time in
his lesson in school.</p>

<p>On the whole, these books are very satisfactory, and
afford the critical reader the rare pleasure of the works that
are just adequate, that easily fulfill themselves and accomplish
all they set out to do.&mdash;<i>Scribner's Monthly.</i></p>
